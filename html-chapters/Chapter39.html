Her name was Mabel."</p><p>"Myrtle! Her name was Myrtle."</p><p>"And she was way younger than you, but you don't know exactly what year. And her body was found in the girls' lavatory on the second floor."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"And she's a ghost."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"So why haven't I ever heard of her before? I mean, after eleven and a half years I should know all the ghosts."</p><p>"It is a girls' lavatory. And I don't think Myrtle was ever fond of either boys or professors, so you lose on both counts." McGonagall looked down her nose with a decidedly superior attitude.</p><p>"Was anyone else on staff at Hogwarts at the time. Besides Dumbledore, I mean."</p><p>"Binns, of course, but he'll be of no use. Kettleburn. Oh, and Hagrid was a student. You might want to talk to him. There was also Tom Riddle, but I expect you already know that."</p><p>Snape went up to the second floor that evening to check the girl's lavatory. There were so few students, all of whom were in their dormitories anyway, that he had no fear of meeting anyone. Just to be sure, he knocked on the door before going in.</p><p>It was a perfectly ordinary lavatory. There was a row of stalls with toilets, and opposite each toilet was a sink with soap and hand towels, and a hamper for the used towels. The hamper was empty. Like the rest of the school, the plumbing here had been installed just before World War I. In all respects, it was one of the more modern of Hogwarts's rooms.</p><p>"Is that you, Harry?" came a small voice from one of the stalls, and a young girl ghost came gliding out. She stopped and fled back to the stall when she saw it was a teacher.</p><p>"Myrtle?" Snape said calmly. "How do you know Harry?" There was no answer, only a splashing from one of the stalls, and Snape assumed the ghost had left.</p><p><em>Is this the scene of the crime, the place where they made the Polyjuice potion? It may have been a good choice, since McGonagall says it's seldom used because of Myrtle. Potter was one, Granger another, and probably Weasley. Asking Malfoy about the Chamber of Secrets.</em></p><p>Snape left the second floor and returned to his dungeon office to think.</p><p><em>Why does Potter want to know about the Chamber of Secrets from Malfoy? Malfoy doesn't know anything.</em></p><p><em>The Chamber is open. Only the heir of Slytherin can open it. If the Dark Lord is the heir - and we know he's returned - he would need corporeal servants to assist him. Someone has opened the Chamber for the Dark Lord.</em></p><p><em>I don't think it's Draco. I'm sure Draco knows nothing, but could it be Lucius? Lucius brought a house elf on the day the bludger attacked Potter. Maybe that had something to do with the Chamber. But Lucius wasn't here when it was opened. So he had to get someone to do it for him.</em></p><p><em>What if it is Potter? Dumbledore says he's a Parselmouth because of his contact with the Dark Lord. What if there's more contact that Potter isn't conscious of?</em></p><p><em>What if the Dark Lord can watch us, watch me, through Potter's eyes?</em></p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p>The students returned with the new year. Almost immediately, the rumor spread that Granger had been attacked by the monster from the Chamber of Secrets, and students kept trying to get a glimpse of her. The truth of the matter was, though, that there were no more attacks. Everything settled down to routine, though Snape kept a much closer eye on Potter than before.</p><p>With the full moon, the last of the ingredients for Granger's potion were collected, and by mid January she was taking regular doses and showing visible improvement. Snape kept the potion brewing in his office, and carried the necessary amount up to Madam Pomfrey each day to be sure it was fresh.</p><p>On one of these trips, on an evening toward the end of January, he met Filch stomping down the stairs on his way to the broom cupboard. The caretaker was furious.</p><p>"These students have nothing better to do with their time than make work for me, Professor," he complained. "Some of 'em has gone and flooded the lavatory on the second floor. I'll be half the night mopping it up."</p><p>Questioning revealed it was Myrtle's lavatory. Snape decided to accompany Filch back to the second floor and have another look.</p><p>Water was running down the second floor corridor and onto the staircases. Filch, glad of a sympathetic ear, continued his complaining. "Don't know how they did it. Ceiling wet, walls wet, candles guttered and soaking, floor two inches deep. These students've got nothing better they can do but torment me. I went straight to Dumbledore and told him I can't take it anymore..."</p><p>"You went to Dumbledore before you came downstairs?" Snape asked, mentally working out times as he helped Filch relight the candles and begin sweeping the water toward the drains.</p><p>"I did. And I told him I wasn't going to take it anymore."</p><p>"How long do you think that took you?"</p><p>Filch eyed Snape suspiciously. "Maybe fifteen, twenty minutes. But if you're thinking I let them get away, you're wrong. I checked first. They weren't in here."</p><p>"How did you discover it?"</p><p>"I was keeping an eye out, right over there where... where Mrs. Norris was attacked. I heard the water splashing and saw it coming out the door. They can't leave me alone. It was the same on Halloween night. I had to spend the night mopping and worrying about Mrs. Norris at the same time."</p><p>Snape straightened up. "There was water on the floor that night? I don't recall..." He conjured up an image of what he'd seen, but the corridor had been so full of students that he had no memory of what the floor looked like.</p><p>"Not so bad as this tonight, but puddles of it everywhere all the same. Oh, I could've wrung their necks."</p><p>It was worth waiting. Snape stayed until the lavatory was relatively dry and Filch left. Then he called quietly, "Myrtle. Myrtle, what happened here?" There was no response, so he tried again. "Myrtle, I'm not angry. I just want to know what happened."</p><p>Nothing. Either the ghost wasn't there, or she wouldn't talk to teachers. Snape decided to see if McGonagall was still up.</p><p>"Creevey?" McGonagall was reading in her rooms when Snape knocked, but was more than willing to chat. "What do you need to know about Creevey for?"</p><p>"He was the second one attacked, and the first student. Just exactly where was he, and what was he doing?"</p><p>"I'll tell you, Severus, if you promise to keep me informed. It was the night of the Quidditch game, and Potter was in hospital regrowing his arm bones. Creevey was apparently coming up to see him from the kitchens because he was carrying a bunch of grapes. We found the boy on a landing. It seems he was trying to take a picture of the thing that attacked him."</p><p>"Picture?"</p><p>"He was holding his camera up to his face. We don't know if he got the photo or not, for when Dumbledore opened the camera, the film dissolved."</p><p>"Where was that?"</p><p>"When we were putting the poor boy to bed in the hospital."</p><p>"Did Potter see any of this?"</p><p>"I don't think so. I think he was asleep. He certainly didn't move or say anything."</p><p>Snape bade McGonagall good night and went back to his own room. <em>Water on the floor when Mrs. Norris was petrified, Creevey with a camera in front of his eyes, Finch-Fletchley in the company of a ghost. Dead roosters. Maybe it is a basilisk after all. That or something similar. But how is it getting into the castle? And from where?</em></p><p>Snape decided he had to speak to Hagrid, and went down to his hut early the next morning before breakfast.</p><p>Hagrid was always up early, checking the verge of the forest or caring for his garden. He saw Snape coming down the hill in the faint light of dawn and went to be sure there was water heated for tea.</p><p>"Morning, Professor. Bit chill t' be up and about. What can I do for ya?"</p><p>"Sorry to bother you so early, and I have to be brief so I can get back before the students come out for breakfast, but I wanted to ask you about the Chamber of Secrets. You know, what happened last time."</p><p>The response was so less than enthusiastic that Snape was taken aback. Hagrid turned and stomped back toward his hut. "Ya ought t' know that's a sore subject. Come have some tea an' then be off with ya."</p><p>"This is a switch," said Snape as he entered the familiar hut. "You used to be the one trying to get me to come here. Now here I am and you don't want me."</p><p>"Yeah. Well now we're not talking about you, are we?"</p><p>"I didn't think we were going to be talking about you either."</p><p>"No? Then what're ya... Ya don't know what happened then, do ya?"</p><p>"A girl died."</p><p>"Yeah. And I got expelled an' forbidden t' use magic."</p><p>It was that moment when you realize you've stepped into quicksand. Snape plunged forward. "Why? What did you do?"</p><p>"Brought Aragog into the school."</p><p>"Who's Aragog?"</p><p>"He's one of the reasons the forest's forbidden. He's an acromantula. I bought him from a chap... Well, let's just say I got him an' I brought him t' the school an' that Tom Riddle found out an' had me..."</p><p>"Tom Riddle turned you in? Look, Hagrid, did you know the girl who died?"</p><p>"Not really. She were Hufflepuff, and I were Gryffindor. It was all very hush-hush. We were never told at the time what really happened. Nor later on, neither. What're ya so interested in all this for."</p><p>"You know me and mysteries. Besides, it would be good if we could keep anyone else from being hurt. By the way, did she actually die in the girls' lavatory?"</p><p>"Don't know. Didn't never ask about it. That were the rumor, though."</p><p>And that was where it remained for another month. The school as a whole began to relax as there were no further attacks. Professor Sprout's mandrakes were getting along nicely, and Snape began paying her visits when he didn't have classes, just to examine them.</p><p>"Some are more mature than others. Look at these two, Severus. Trying to touch roots through the drainage holes in their pots, thinking no one would notice."</p><p>"We certainly don't want them to grow too quickly," said Snape examining the errant mandrakes, one of which had managed to inch an eye above the level of the compost in its pot and was ogling its neighbor. "It makes the tuber too fibrous for a good decoction." Snape had great respect for Professor Sprout. His own witch grandmother had been both an herbologist and a potions maker - a rare combination - and had taught him the value of herb lore. He himself was fair at Herbology, but knew enough to value greater talent in another.</p><p>"While you're here, Professor," added Sprout, "could you look at the bubotubers? They seem to have picked up a fungus that I'd swear was Pennine greenmolt if we weren't so far north."</p><p>"And some people say there is no evidence for global warming," murmured Snape as he examined the fungus.</p><p>"Global what?"</p><p>Snape explained, and he and Sprout discussed growing seasons, rainfall, and temperature variations until it was time to get ready for supper.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p><em>Sunday, February 14, 1993 [JKRowling talks of this as a school day with classes, but this is a mistake.]</em></p><p>Snape left his dungeon rooms for breakfast a little later than usual since it was Sunday and he had no classes. To his great surprise, McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, and Pomfrey were standing around in the entrance hall with an eye to the dungeon corridor.</p><p>McGonagall saw him first and began positively crowing. "Och, he's here, he's here. Ye'll not believe it, lad, not a bit of it," and she beckoned him to the group.</p><p>Flitwick was chuckling, Sprout was fizzing, and Pomfrey looked like a child caught with candy in her mouth.</p><p>Before Snape could say anything, Flitwick pushed him toward the Great Hall. "Just look, youngster. Then come back and tell us what to do about it.</p><p>It was hideous. The hall was festooned - festooned! - in pink. Wisteria garlands draped from the beams. Two-foot-wide globular blooms that looked like a mad mating of magenta roses, cerise gladiolus, and lavender 'love-lies-bleeding' adorned each torch holder. The grand hearth was a display of fuchsia, heliotrope, orchid, and foxglove, while the walls were plastered with enormous blossoms resembling giant impatiens, pink daisies, and carnations.</p><p>The teachers' table was clothed in honeysuckle, and each professor's chair was arrayed with a floral pagan nimbus, Snape himself being blessed with passion flowers. The floor was strewn with petals, and heart-shaped pink confetti sifted from the rafters like snow.</p><p>"He's in shock," McGonagall whispered to the others as she pulled Snape back from the doors. She fanned his face with her hat as she demanded, "This is that man's idea of Valentine's Day! What do we do?"</p><p>Snape took a deep breath. "Nothing," he replied. "There's nothing we can do."</p><p>"What are you talking about, man? We're not going to take this lying down!" Flitwick was more inflamed than Snape had ever seen him before.</p><p>"Nothing," Snape repeated. "Not in front of the students. We got away with it at Christmas because there were no students here. But teachers do not attack teachers in front of the student body."</p><p>"What about later?" Pomfrey asked.</p><p>The teachers bore it stoically for about five minutes, then they began to seethe. That was because Lockhart, after bragging about the number of valentines he'd received, brought in the dwarfs. Short, squat, bearded dwarfs dressed as cupids. For the purpose, Lockhart explained, of sending singing valentine grams.</p><p>"And the fun doesn't stop here!" Lockhart enthused like a carnival barker. "I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!"</p><p>Flitwick was mortified. Snape gripped the arms of his chair with a force that whitened his knuckles. McGonagall pursed her lips, but was silent. Snape glanced over at McGonagall and mouthed the words, 'He's going down.'</p><p>McGonagall smiled.</p><p>They had fun in the staff room inventing students' names: Cassiopeia Hicks - Mehitible Dusendorf - Palindroma Yamamoto...</p><p>One by one the dwarfs were sent out, each one finding Lockhart in a very public place, eager to receive his accolade from an adoring student.</p><p>'Cassiopeia' sent:</p><p><em>O Lockhart, dear Lockhart, I've waited so long</em></p><p><em>To tell of my love and to sing you this song.</em></p><p><em>Your eyes are so droopy, your hair is so lank</em></p><p><em>You always remind me of fish in a tank.</em></p><p><em>Your mouth always open to let water in,</em></p><p><em>Your face is so narrow, with hardly a chin.</em></p><p><em>There isn't a teacher as squishy as you</em></p><p><em>I love you so madly. Do you love me too?</em></p><p>By the time they got to 'Palindroma's' love song, Lockhart was running from dwarfs as if they carried bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague all at the same time.</p><p>McGonagall reckoned it as: Teachers - 3, Lockhart - 0. It was getting so she had to figure in a point spread.</p><p>McGonagall and Sprout had followed the first dwarf up to watch Lockhart receive his gram.</p><p>"He was preening like a peacock, strut and all, until the line about his hair being lank, then he began to fall to pieces. He didn't know whether to be embarrassed, angry, or happy that some idiot girl with no talent had sent him a love message. Pomona and I pretended we weren't listening so he wouldn't suspect us. It was lovely."</p><p>Flitwick and Pomfrey had gone up for the second message and reported back as well. This time Lockhart was wary of the dwarf, but was willing to give it a try until the lines:</p><p><em>Lips of fire, fingers of glue,</em></p><p><em>I love you, yes, I do! I do!</em></p><p>at which he turned beet red and hurried away.</p><p>Snape had waited until last since he had always considered both discretion and the final result more important than personal satisfaction. There being one more singing gram, however, and the others already having had their turn, he allowed himself the luxury of following the dwarf to Lockhart's office on the second floor to see what would happen. <em>Probably nothing. He'll just leave at the sight of a dwarf by this time.</em></p><p>It was right after lunch, and students were streaming back to their dormitories. Another dwarf scuttled past Snape on its way up to the first floor, calling out, "Oy, you! 'Arry Potter!" as it pushed students out of its path. Snape looked up in time to see Potter dart into the first floor corridor, clearly anxious to escape.</p><p><em>This might be more interesting than Lockhart.</em> Snape followed the crowd up the stairs. Most of them were younger students, so he hung back out of sight, still able to see everything over their heads. What he saw was the dwarf holding on to Potter's torn book bag as the boy tried to gather up his spilled belongings. Students were hopping quickly away from the pile to avoid the - blood? - no, the red ink that spread out from a broken bottle and drenched the books.</p><p>Two voices demanded imperiously what was happening, and Snape saw Malfoy and Percy Weasley push forward. At that point Potter tried to run, but the dwarf tackled him and sat on him to sing its doggerel. The 'valentine' was clearly a joke.</p><p>Snape had long before, in more dangerous times, learned to pay attention to the real action rather than the show. While the students laughed at Potter and the dwarf, Snape watched Malfoy. <em>You wrote that valentine to embarrass Potter. Where did you get the idea? Have you been listening at the door to the staff room? Maybe I should keep a closer watch on you in the future.</em></p><p>Then it was over. Weasley, enjoying his status as a prefect, was breaking up the crowd. The dwarf left, and Potter went back to his stained and damaged books. Malfoy picked one up. It wasn't a school book, it was more like an old-fashioned appointment book, the kind sold in muggle shops. Seeing potential conflict, Snape started to move forward, then paused. There was a prefect there to keep order. He didn't have to intervene unless things got out of hand.</p><p>"Give that back," Potter said in a low voice.</p><p>"Wonder what Potter's written in this?" Malfoy teased.</p><p>"Hand it over, Malfoy."</p><p>"When I've had a look."</p><p>Weasley moved in. "As a school prefect..."</p><p>Potter's wand was suddenly out, and he yelled <em>"Expelliarmus!"</em> The book flew out of Malfoy's hands straight into the air. That was when Snape noticed the other two Weasleys in the thinning crowd, for Potter's friend Ron caught the book as it fell, and right behind him was the first year girl Ginny. She had a look of absolute horror on her face.</p><p>"No magic in the corridors!" the Weasley prefect was shouting, so after exchanging parting insults, the combatants broke off their confrontation and departed in different directions.</p><p>Snape returned to the staff room where he had to confess that he hadn't seen Lockhart get his last 'valentine.' He blamed it on a little 'disorder' in the corridor without going into specifics, then the five conspirators left for their separate rooms.</p><p>Once in his own room, Snape sat to think for a while. <em>Expelliarmus is not a lower-level charm. Potter can't have encountered it in his classes. He had to have learned it from me when I used it against Lockhart two months ago. Saw it and heard it once, then used it correctly and powerfully when needed. The boy must have more talent than he's ever shown in lessons to pick up something like that so quickly.</em></p><p>Then there were the other details. <em>Why was that appointment book so important that Potter used magic in the corridor to get it back? And why was Ginny Weasley so frightened?</em></p><p>A few days later, Snape was in Dumbledore's office.</p><p>"Unless it's some monster that's never been catalogued, it seems to be closer to a basilisk than anything. We might be able to account for the fact that no one has died by a remarkable series of coincidences. Filch tells me that there was water on the floor the night Mrs. Norris was petrified, and she may have seen the monster's reflection. The Creevey boy was looking through a camera lens, and if Sir Nicholas was between the Finch-Fletchley boy and the beast, the boy would not have looked at it directly either. I don't think it's ever been documented that meeting the reflection of a basilisk's eye causes Petrification rather than death, but there's no reason why not."</p><p>"And the roosters?" Dumbledore asked.</p><p>"That's one of the worrisome things. They weren't killed by a basilisk. They weren't killed by an animal either. A person killed the roosters. It could be another coincidence, or it could mean a person is assisting the basilisk."</p><p>"The Heir of Slytherin, except the Heir of Slytherin is not at Hogwarts this year."</p><p>"Not that we know of."</p><p>"You said 'one' of the worrisome things."</p><p>"I don't know how it gets around. If it's the same monster that attacked that girl in 1943, it must be huge by now, yet no one has seen it or any trace of it."</p><p>"Do you have any suggestions?"</p><p>"Invest in weasels. Lots and lots of weasels."</p><p>"Too bad Weasleys would not do as well. We do have lots and lots of them."</p><p>Snape smiled at Dumbledore's little joke, then changed the subject, not feeling particularly like discussing Weasleys that evening. "I wanted to ask you something else. Last year you started to tell me about Riddle and Potter and, well, me. I've been thinking about it. Something happened on Valentine's Day and Potter used an Expelliarmus against Malfoy. I was there. It was impressive. The boy has... instincts."</p><p>"Very powerful instincts. Quite different from yours. Your instincts are all mental. I have never met an Occlumens as powerful or instinctive as you, and you have a gift for defending yourself in face-to-face situations, not to mention your ability to create new spells. Potter's instincts are more physical - his skill with a broom, his quickness in picking up and using spells right when they are needed. Riddle was all planning, all carefully worked-out detail. I do not know if he ever did anything by instinct."</p><p>"So you don't think of us as the same?"</p><p>"Heavens no! I hope I did not give you that impression. In many ways, you are the antithesis that produces the synthesis. Riddle and Potter are creatures of the world. Riddle does not care if it hates him as long as he can control it. Potter does not want control, only love and support. You just wish the world would leave you alone. Riddle lives by masterful deceit. Potter's attempts at deceit are so transparent that they have never really bothered me. Your idea of deception is to build a wall and hide behind it. Riddle does not understand the concept of love, Potter craves love, and you are afraid to love."</p><p>"That's getting a bit personal!" Snape said, half rising from his chair. "I don't think I like this conversation any more."</p><p>"Sit down. Lily told me what happened after your parents died. It explained much that had been confusing about you. Of the three boys, you are the one who knows what it means to live with an abiding sense of guilt. Another concept that Riddle does not understand."</p><p>"All right, all right. I think you've given me quite enough to think about. Now I'm sorry I asked."</p><p>"Any time," said Dumbledore.</p><p>From then through the Easter break, there were basically three things occupying Snape's mind. The first was classes, getting his seventh years ready for their NEWTs, the fifth years ready for their OWLs, and the rest prepared for exams. Since he only accepted students into his advanced potions classes who had gotten Outstanding in their OWL, the highest level classes were a joy to teach, much more like university seminars than like secondary courses.</p><p>The second thing was the mandrake potion for the petrified victims of the mysterious attacker. One of the biggest problems with adolescent mandrakes was that they were so much like adolescent humans. They were driven by raging hormones, totally lacking in self-control, and devoid of any sense of responsibility. The good thing was that he got to chop them up and boil them into a decoction. <em>Pity I can't do that with the students. What would student potion be good for? Removing age spots?</em></p><p>The third thing was counseling for the second years. As third years, they would have to take two extra classes each. This was the first step on the path of career counseling and choice, and the students were generally advised to play to their strengths. Malfoy, for example, was counseled to take Arithmancy, a must for any job in wizarding finance, and Care of Magical Creatures, which always came in handy in a variety of foreign affairs positions.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p>The last Quidditch game of the year was set for the second Saturday in May, Gryffindor against Hufflepuff. At the moment, Slytherin and Gryffindor were tied, with two wins each. If Gryffindor won their last game, they would win the Quidditch cup. If they lost, then the two teams would count points to see who got the cup. Since Ravenclaw had won its game against Hufflepuff, Hufflepuff was not in the running for the cup, so Slytherin was cheering for Hufflepuff. Snape asked Sprout the evening before if he could join her in her box, and she said he was welcome.</p><p>Most of the school was already in the stands by the time Snape arrived. The two teams were filing out onto the field, and Madam Hooch was getting ready to start the game. The weather was beautiful, and it promised to be a pleasant afternoon. Snape was more relaxed than he'd been at a Quidditch game for some time, for Gryffindor had played Ravenclaw in March, and there had been no incidents.</p><p>Suddenly, surprisingly, McGonagall was hurrying onto the field with a large purple megaphone in her hand. Stopping where the sound would reach all the stands, she called, "This match has been canceled."</p><p>Amid the boos from the students and the protests of the players, Snape and the other teachers rose immediately and began leaving the stands. Something had happened, and they would be needed at the Castle.</p><p>McGonagall continued, "All students are to make their way back to the house common rooms, where their heads of houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please."</p><p>It was serious. It was possibly deadly serious. The teachers hurried up the hill as quickly as they could. Dumbledore was waiting for them in the staff room.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Snape entered the Slytherin common room. Every eye turned to him.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to have to inform you that another attack has occurred against students of this school." Snape could tell from their faces that they already knew it couldn't be a Slytherin student. The first thing they would have done was check if any from their house were missing.</p><p>"More mudbloods?" Malfoy asked with a sneer.</p><p>"Master Malfoy," Snape said with icy calm, "I will thank you never to use that word in my presence again, or anywhere else for that matter. An attack against any student in this school is an attack against all. The two victims this time were Miss Granger of Gryffindor and Miss Clearwater of Ravenclaw. They were attacked near the Library. Both have been petrified and are in the hospital wing." Snape watched Malfoy the whole time he spoke, and the boy was wise enough to keep quiet.</p><p>"Due to the seriousness of the situation, certain rules are being put into effect. No student is to be outside the common room or dormitories unless a teacher is with them. I shall escort you to breakfast and from that point you will be taken to your lessons by your teachers. All students must be in their houses by six o'clock, and supper will be served in the common room. No student may go anywhere in the main building unaccompanied by a teacher, and that includes the lavatories as well as the Library, classrooms, Great Hall, etc."</p><p>"Sir," asked Bulstrode. "Are we in any danger?"</p><p>"Very possibly. There is a chance that the school will have to be closed if we can't discover soon what is causing these attacks. We don't think anything can get into the dormitories except through the common room. I shall be staying in the common room at night as a guard. Now, I need to patrol the school with the other teachers. If there are no questions? Prefects, see that the students obey the rules. I'll be back in the evening."</p><p>Snape left to look for McGonagall.</p><p>Snape and McGonagall were assigned an evening patrol around the entrance hall. Snape took the side with the corridors to the dungeons and the kitchens, while McGonagall patrolled the Great Hall. They met every ten minutes in the entrance hall to check in and chat. Snape didn't really expect anything to happen. None of the previous attacks had been followed immediately by other attacks. Still, it was better to be cautious.</p><p>Well after nightfall, Dumbledore came downstairs, accompanied by Filch. "No time to talk, Severus," he called from the stairs. "Cornelius Fudge is coming in at the Hogsmeade gate, and I have to be there to meet him. I trust everything is quiet."</p><p>Whether Dumbledore's opening the main doors had let in pollen, or it was something else, a few minutes later Snape found himself sneezing. At the same time, he thought he heard a strange noise, as of someone swearing at something. He paused to listen carefully, but there was no further sound.</p><p>It was a night of surprises. Shortly afterwards, Lucius Malfoy appeared at the main entrance. Malfoy was looking for Dumbledore and, finding himself talking to Snape, smiled and confided that it was a message from the Board of Governors that Dumbledore was not going to like. <em>No wonder Malfoy's willing to deliver it himself. I can't imagine another reason why he'd agree to be a messenger boy.</em> Snape dearly wanted to go with Malfoy and find out what was happening, but his duty required him to stay on guard at the castle.</p><p>A short while later, while Snape was telling McGonagall the events of the night, they all returned: Dumbledore, Fudge, Hagrid, and Malfoy. And there, where all of them could see his reactions, Snape learned that Hagrid was under arrest and going to Azkaban, while the Board of Governors had suspended Dumbledore, who was leaving Hogwarts immediately.</p><p>Glancing from one to the other, Snape was relieved to see that Dumbledore was gently shaking his head. <em>Play along. Don't make any rash statements. Don't take sides. Especially not in front of Malfoy.</em> Not that he had to take sides; McGonagall was doing fine all by herself.</p><p>"Lucius Malfoy, I have seen you do some silly, foolish things in my time, but this is utter madness! Do you want the situation to get worse? Do you want more students hurt and Hogwarts closed? You know as well as anyone standing here that Professor Dumbledore is our best hope to resolve this problem. One might think you had something to do with it."</p><p>"Now, Professor," interjected Fudge, and she turned on him.</p><p>"And you, you big puffed-up bureaucrat, Hagrid is no more involved in this than I am. Instead of throwing your authority in people's faces like some strutting little cockerel, you might be doing something to actually get to the bottom of this and stop these attacks."</p><p>Dumbledore stepped forward and took her hands in his. "Do not fret, Minerva. Everything will be fine. This is only temporary. You are in charge until I return, and I know you will do all in your power to protect the school. You can rely on all the other teachers to help you. Now, I fear we must be going."</p><p>Malfoy had said nothing, but as he turned to leave, he nodded to Snape, and Snape inclined his head slightly in reply. Then they were gone.</p><p>"And you!" cried McGonagall, rounding on Snape. "You might have said something to back me up! Standing there like a great mute lump! If I didn't know you better I'd think you were half pleased to see them haul Dumbledore and Hagrid off."</p><p>As McGonagall advanced, Snape retreated. He couldn't explain to her, so it was probably just as well that he couldn't get a word in edgewise. When she'd backed him as far as the dungeon stairs, he fled to Slytherin house, leaving her raging in the entrance hall.</p><p>The common room was empty, and Snape settled gratefully on a sofa by the fireplace, trying to reason out what had just happened.</p><p><em>The Dark Lord is back and his hand can stretch into Hogwarts. He's opened the Chamber of Secrets - it's only a matter of time before people start dying. He's used Malfoy to remove Dumbledore - what other lines of defense are being destroyed.? Dumbledore wants me to stay under cover, but what good is that going to do if the Dark Lord already knows I've left him? How much does he know? How much did he get from Quirrell?</em></p><p><em>Yet Malfoy seems to think I'm still on his side. That's a hopeful sign. I just have to be careful. Spies. He has spies in the school. Draco, and the Crabbe and Goyle boys. Who else is the son, daughter, niece, nephew, cousin of a Death Eater? Every word I say, every move I make can be reported. Even with the teachers I have to be on my guard, lest they talk where students can listen.</em></p><p><em>And the Ministry has sent Hagrid to Azkaban. With Dumbledore gone, how long before Moody comes to get me, too?</em></p><p>Snape dozed fitfully by the fire, dreamed of being dragged bound and helpless before the Dark Lord, and woke unrefreshed with the dawn.</p><p>The school went into a state of shock and siege. It was easy for the teachers to keep the students together in escorted groups, for no student wanted to be alone. The hospital wing was sealed off in case the monster, or whatever it was, wanted to get at the petrified victims. The fact that Dumbledore was no longer there made everyone nervous. When not acting as escorts, the teachers gathered in little groups to talk about their fears. The only one who seemed happy was Lockhart, who was convinced that the Ministry was infallible and had arrested Hagrid because he was the guilty party. The rest of the teachers stopped talking to him altogether.</p><p>Snape couldn't join the others. He couldn't talk to anyone about his own worry and apprehension. At Hogwarts, only Dumbledore and Hagrid knew of his duel role in the last year of Voldemort's power, and only Dumbledore and Hagrid knew that that role remained ambiguous, had to remain ambiguous if he was ever going to be useful to them again. The power that could remove both of them from Hogwarts at the same moment was the only thing that Snape truly feared, and in empty rooms and corridors, or the privacy of his own office, he checked the mark on his left arm a dozen times a day to see if it was getting darker, dreading that it might start to burn and summon him to the Dark Lord.</p><p>Two weeks after Dumbledore's suspension, Draco Malfoy spoke up in class, talking to Crabbe and Goyle, but loudly enough that many of the students could hear.</p><p>"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore. I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in..."</p><p>Snape started to admonish Malfoy, then froze. <em>I'm being tested. How I react and what I say will be reported back to Lucius, and through Lucius to... I have to be noncommittal, neither fish nor fowl, nothing to jeopardize my position either at Hogwarts or with the Dark Lord.</em> Snape chose to say nothing, but continued checking student work in the class.</p><p>Malfoy called out to him. "Sir! Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?"</p><p><em>Steady, Severus, steady. You're talking to both the Dark Lord and Cornelius Fudge now. Nothing is private anymore.</em> Snape forced a weak smile. "Now, now, Malfoy. Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I dare say he'll be back with us soon enough."</p><p>"Yeah, right. I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir -"</p><p>Snape decided the best way to keep Malfoy quiet was not to respond, and he continued through the class checking the students' potions. But what Malfoy'd said bothered him immensely. <em>Does the wind blow that way? Does the Dark Lord want a puppet headmaster at Hogwarts? Or is this just Malfoy shooting off his mouth?</em></p><p>But Malfoy wouldn't be quiet. "I'm quite surprised the mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now. Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn't Granger -"</p><p>Weasley was off his stool and heading for Malfoy just as the bell rang, and Snape moved fast to get between the two boys. "Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology," he shouted, and the confrontation was avoided.</p><p>The rest of the day, Snape was miserable. The calmer, saner part of him kept saying that it was just Draco. Just Draco trying to be the center of attention and bragging about his family's position and influence. The nervous, worried part of him kept asking 'Why now?' Draco was silent for two weeks, then suddenly in public, in a class shared with Gryffindors, challenged him about Dumbledore and about wanting to be headmaster. <em>He was told to do that. He was following his father's instructions. They're planning another move, and they're trying to confirm which side I'm on. I can't go to Dumbledore for advice. What would he want me to do?</em></p><p>To make matters worse, they were told the next day that exams would not be canceled, and he had only about a week to make sure his classes were prepared. <em>It never rains, but it pours.</em></p><p>xxxxxxxxxx</p><p><em>Friday, May 28, 1993 (the first quarter)</em></p><p>Sprout hurried up to Snape before he could sit down at breakfast. "They're ready! I think they're ready! You have to come check them, especially the roots, but I'm sure they're ready."</p><p>Food could wait. Snape turned to the teachers' table where he knew eyes were fixed on the pair of them, and gave McGonagall a thumbs-up. She clapped her hands in delight as Snape and the short dumpy herbologist rushed from the Great Hall with nothing on their minds except the mandrakes and the Restorative Draught for those in the hospital.</p><p>In the warm dampness of the greenhouse, both professors fixed plugs into their ears, and then Sprout pulled one of the mandrakes halfway out of its pot. The root opened its mouth immediately and began screaming, but neither of them could hear it. Snape prodded it. It was just the right texture for the decoction. Together he and Sprout selected two others, wrapped the three pots in blankets and carried them into the school.</p><p>Returning to the Great Hall, Snape announced, "I need prefects, prefects from all houses for about fifteen minutes." Twenty-three students rose to join him, the twenty-fourth being Miss Clearwater, petrified in the hospital wing. In the entrance hall he gathered them around him.</p><p>"This is simple," he told them, "but vitally important. In a few moments, Professor Sprout and I will be in my office dispatching the mandrakes for the Restorative Draught. No one can be within hearing of them when they cry out. Slytherin prefects, go into the dormitories and be sure no one is still anywhere in Slytherin house. You other prefects, check every corridor and room in the dungeons, and get everyone out here into the entrance hall. When all's ready, you'll guard the staircase while Professor Sprout and I kill the mandrakes. Then you can go back to breakfast.</p><p>It was, in fact, amazing how many students were in the dungeon area. When the prefects reported all clear, Snape and Sprout went into his office, donned their earplugs and, pulling the mandrakes one by one from their pots, quickly cut off their tops and split each one down the middle. The resemblance of the roots to human children was somewhat distressing, but Snape tried to think of lobster bisque and crab Louie. Taken in a larger context, it was not so bad.</p><p>All of Snape's classes for the day were canceled, and his students told to remain in their common rooms until their next classes. This included, of course, his morning double session with the first years. He'd chopped the roots into a medium dice and begun stewing them with rosemary, bay, and a few cinnamon sticks (How many people realize that potions are not dissimilar to cooking?), when McGonagall's voice came to him on the intercom system.</p><p>"All students to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers return to the staff room. Immediately, please."</p><p>Snape checked his equipment to be sure everything was brewing nicely, then hurried to the staff room.</p><p>Despite his proximity, Snape was not the first there, Flitwick was. They stood together as one by one their colleagues filtered into the room. The last to arrive was McGonagall.</p><p>"It has happened," she announced almost at once. "A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself."</p><p>Amid the gasps and cries of surprise, Snape looked down and realized he was gripping the back of a chair so tightly that his knuckles were white. Staring straight at McGonagall, he said, "How can you be sure?" and heard his own voice rasping hoarse and unnatural in the stillness.</p><p>McGonagall glanced around. "The Heir of Slytherin left another message. Right underneath the first one. 'Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.'"</p><p>"Who is it? Which student?" asked Madam Hooch.</p><p>McGonagall looked grave. "Ginny Weasley," she said. "We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow. This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said..."</p><p>The staff room door banged open. "So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?"</p><p>It was Gilderoy Lockhart.</p><p>It was too much to take, on top of everything else, that they would have to deal with Lockhart, too. A glance around the room showed that the entire staff was agreed and looked to their natural leaders, the four heads of houses, for action.</p><p>Snape advanced towards Lockhart, trying to keep his voice moderate. "Just the man, the very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last."</p><p>This was so clearly not what Lockhart wanted that he went white as a ghost. Sprout moved in for her turn.</p><p>"That's right, Gilderoy. Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?"</p><p>"I - well - I -" but Flitwick cut him off.</p><p>"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?"</p><p>"D-did I? I don't recall..."</p><p>Snape pounced again. "I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested. Didn't you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?"</p><p>"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood..."</p><p>To McGonagall went the honors of pounding in the last nail. "We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy. Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We'll make sure everyone's out of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free rein at last."</p><p>"V-very well. I'll - I'll be in my office, getting - getting ready." And Lockhart was gone.</p><p>The first concern was that no other students be attacked. McGonagall ordered the teachers into the corridors and onto the grounds to be sure that no single student in the whole school was outside the dormitories. Heads of houses were to go to their common rooms for a head count and to advise the students to start packing their things, for the school would be evacuated the next morning.</p><p>All were to return to the staff room as soon as they were sure that every other student had been accounted for, and that the school was clear.</p><p>"I have sent owls," McGonagall informed the rest, once they'd gathered again shortly after noon, "to the Board of Governors, to the Ministry and, of course, to the Weasleys, informing them of what has happened. Oh, and to Professor Dumbledore as well, but that was not an official owl. I have also arranged with the Hogwarts Express for a special run down to London tomorrow, and we've started getting the owls out to the other parents, though that will take some time to complete, telling them the children will be at King's Cross late tomorrow afternoon. Now, what do we know, and what can we do?" She looked at Snape.</p><p>"There is a good chance that what we're dealing with is a basilisk," he told them. "So far we've never had two attacks close together, so I would guess it's returned to its lair to rest. I have no idea why it would take Miss Weasley, since so far all the victims have been muggle-born and she's a pureblood, unless that was just coincidence."</p><p>"Ginny did look a bit upset at breakfast this morning," said McGonagall. "I wonder if there's any connection."</p><p>"Can we try to rescue her? Do we know how this thing gets into the Castle?" asked Madam Hooch.</p><p>"I fear she is probably already dead," replied McGonagall. "And we don't have a clue how it gets in or how it moves around undetected."</p><p>"Master Creevey was attacked on the stairs between the ground floor and the first floor," said Snape, "Mrs. Norris on the second floor, Miss Granger and Miss Clearwater on the fourth floor near the Library, and Master Finch-Fletchley and Sir Nicholas on the fifth floor. We don't know where Miss Weasley was taken, but the messages were on the second floor."</p><p>"The girl fifty years ago was rumored to have been killed in the second floor bathroom," said McGonagall. "Might there be a connection?"</p><p>"I don't know how. The Chamber, if build by Slytherin, is nearly a thousand years old. The bathrooms are less than a hundred years old. I would suspect the Chamber of being underground, but we've never seen any sign of the monster in the dungeon or kitchen area." Snape looked to Professor Sprout for confirmation, and she nodded.</p><p>The teachers went out again to search the whole Castle for possible ways the monster may have entered. Snape started to join them when he was blocked by McGonagall. "And where do you think you're going? You march right back to your office and work on that Restorative Draught, young man. I want those people in the hospital unpetrified and on the train tomorrow with the other students."</p><p>Snape nodded and returned to his potions work.</p><p>All afternoon the teachers searched the school, and all afternoon Snape worked on his potion. Sprout dropped in from time to time to see how he was getting on and bring him news.</p><p>"Molly Weasley's arrived. Arthur's still at the Ministry, but he'll be here soon. Have you ever met her?"</p><p>"After a fashion. She's come to Quidditch games and we've been introduced. A woman of great strengths, it would seem. Pass the flax seed, please."</p><p>Well after nightfall, the potion was in its last stages of brewing, and Snape was getting it down to the proper concentration when there was a knock on his office door.</p><p>"Come," he called, unable to leave the bubbling concoction.</p><p>Dumbledore walked into the office. "They said you would be hard at work. How is it coming?"</p><p>"You have no idea how pleased I am to see you. If it weren't for the potion, I'd be tempted to hug you."</p><p>"It has been that bad, eh?"</p><p>"Worse. At least the Restorative Draught'll be ready in about an hour."</p><p>"Lockhart is gone."</p><p>Snape almost stopped stirring the potion. "I knew he didn't really want to face the monster, but I didn't think he'd just pack up and leave. All we wanted to do was get him out of our hair."</p><p>"He has not packed and left. At least he has not finished packing - he was clearly in the process. No, he is gone. We do not know where, though we know he has not left the grounds."</p><p>Snape stared down at the surface of the potion. "You don't think he really knew where the entrance to the Chamber was, do you? After all our teasing, could it be true that he really went to fight the monster?"</p><p>"I would be very surprised, but it is nonetheless another mystery. Do let me know when you take that up to Madam Pomfrey."</p><p>An hour and a half later, Snape knocked at the door of McGonagall's office on his way to the hospital wing with the doses of Restorative Draught. He was reintroduced to the Weasleys, who seemed remarkably calm under the circumstances, and then he went to see Madam Pomfrey.</p><p>The patients had to be brought around one by one so that the two of them could deal with muscle cramps, nausea, and congestion before moving on to the next one. It was a tedious process, but quite successful considering that Creevey had been petrified for nearly seven months.</p><p>Just as they finished reviving Granger and were about to start on Clearwater, Madam Pomfrey looked towards the door, dropped the spoon she was holding, and clapped a hand to her mouth. Turning in surprise, Snape saw Arthur and Molly Weasley. Standing between them, looking very sheepish, was Ginny.</p><p>"Oh, child," gasped Pomfrey, "are you all right? Come over here quickly, let me look at you. Sit down on the bed here. Professor can you continue with Miss Clearwater on your own? You must be Miss Weasley's parents - please sit here..." Pomfrey rolled up the hospital privacy curtains and shielded the Weasleys from view.</p><p>Snape got Clearwater sitting up with a glass of pumpkin juice and started on Mrs. Norris and Sir Nicholas. He was burning, absolutely burning, with curiosity, but needed to work slowly and carefully to see that the patients would recover well.</p><p>Finally able to leave the hospital wing, Snape was surprised to find the corridors filled with students making their way to the Great Hall. Descending the stairs, he spied McGonagall.</p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>"Oh, it's so exciting! Potter found the Chamber of Secrets and killed the monster! You were right. It was a basilisk, but it's gone now. Dumbledore has ordered a feast."</p><p>Snape looked around. He could see Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff students, but no one coming up from the dungeons.</p><p>"Um, I don't want to be pushy or anything, but has anyone told Slytherin house?"</p><p>"Each house has been told by its head. We thought that would be... Oh! You were in the hospital weren't you?"</p><p>"That's all right. I'll get them up now." And Snape went down into the dungeon to the Slytherin common room to tell his students the good news and send them up to the feast.</p><p>Snape was in Dumbledore's office the next day, discussing the details.</p><p>"So, the Dark Lord was never really involved. You're sure. You know one hundred percent that he had nothing to do with this."</p><p>"One hundred percent, Severus, at least not Riddle as he is today, so you can relax."</p><p>"Not Riddle as he is today. Why don't I like the sound of that?"</p><p>Dumbledore reached into a drawer of his desk. "Here. Look at this."</p><p>Snape took the mutilated book carefully, wondering why it seemed familiar. Then he remembered. "This is the appointment book Potter took back from Malfoy on Valentine's Day. What happened to it? It looks like someone stabbed it, like it's been bleeding ink."</p><p>"Turn it over."</p><p>Snape did and read the name 'Tom Marvolo Riddle.' "This was his?" he asked. "How did Potter get hold of it?"</p><p>"It seems it was among the possessions of Lucius Malfoy, who only knew about it that it was somehow connected with opening the Chamber of Secrets. He wanted to discredit Arthur Weasley. It seems Weasley's section of the Ministry is conducting raids to uncover illegal artifacts. Malfoy reasoned that if a member of Weasley's family were responsible for opening the Chamber, Weasley would be sacked. Malfoy slipped it among Ginny Weasley's books in Diagon Alley. Look at it more carefully."</p><p>Snape turned the thing over in his hands, then noted how none of the pages had writing, how the ink had issued from the holes like blood from wounds. "Potter stabbed it?"</p><p>"With a basilisk fang."</p><p>"Would Miss Weasley truly have died?"</p><p>"Oh yes. She was nearly dead when Potter found her."</p><p>"Yet walked quite easily into the hospital wing shortly thereafter. Tell me, did Potter see Riddle?"</p><p>"Saw him, spoke with him, was threatened by him... Destroying Riddle, a teenage Riddle, by stabbing the book was how Potter saved Ginny Weasley's life."</p><p>Snape leaned forward and carefully placed the book in front of Dumbledore. "I've read about them. Never saw one before."</p><p>Dumbledore peered over his glasses. "You are saying you know what it is?"</p><p>"And you keep saying I would make a poor Dark Arts instructor. It's a kind of Horcrux."</p><p>"A kind of Horcrux?"</p><p>"It's just that I would expect it to bring back a more recent version of Riddle, not a fifty-year-old one. And not with something so simple as one girl's sacrifice. But then no one knows everything there is to know about Horcruxes."</p><p>"You would make an excellent Dark Arts instructor. What I keep saying is that I do not want you for my Dark Arts instructor. Not yet, anyway."</p><p>"So there's still hope?"</p><p>"Only if the world becomes much darker than it is today. But back to the question at hand. Does not the existence of this disturb you?"</p><p>"Not really. It's been destroyed. That means Riddle can't use it to come back in full bodily form."</p><p>"What if it is not the only one?"</p><p>Snape looked at his hands, at the floor, the fireplace, the diary, and then at Dumbledore. "It's foolish to make one Horcrux. To make more is the depth, breadth, and height of folly."</p><p>"And yet if anyone could do it, it would be Tom Riddle. I do not believe a more intelligent student ever passed through the doors of Hogwarts."</p><p>"I see. To be thought intelligent one needs a psychopathic personality and a desire to rule..."</p><p>"I said intelligent. I did not say wise."</p><p>"Sorry, Sir. I was out of line. I was wondering if you could explain a few more things to me. I'm still trying to figure out how I could've been so wrong."</p><p>"Wrong? I did not think you were wrong. You realized it was a basilisk."</p><p>"A big basilisk from what McGonagall tells me. Twenty feet long and as big around as a small tree. Where did it come from? How did it move around the school?"</p><p>"Why, in the plumbing system, of course. The entry to the Chamber was under a sink in the second floor girl's lavatory."</p><p>"That's not possible."</p><p>"No? Why not?"</p><p>"First, Salazar Slytherin lived a thousand years ago. Flush toilets are about one hundred fifty years old, and the lavatories here were installed just before World War I. Why didn't the crew that put in the plumbing notice that they were connecting it to the Chamber of Secrets? Then, there are no pipes used in the interiors of buildings that can accommodate a twenty-foot long basilisk."</p><p>"How do you know this?"</p><p>"Common knowledge. Muggle knowledge. Something a pureblood would never think of."</p><p>"Only muggle-borns and half-bloods. Riddle was a half-blood. Did you know? Raised a muggle in a muggle orphanage. Of my three boys, you were the only one who knew he was a wizard before getting his invitation to Hogwarts."</p><p>"I didn't know that. So maybe he altered the plumbing to further his plans with the basilisk. It would've been a difficult and time-consuming job."</p><p>"Something he probably planned for years. He was the long-term planner. You are more the short- to medium-term planner. Potter hardly plans things at all."</p><p>"Why couldn't we find the entrance? We searched the lavatories."</p><p>"Ah, but to open it you needed to be a Parselmouth. The teachers searched in the afternoon. Potter opened it later that night."</p><p>"Does Lucius know he helped destroy Riddle's Horcrux? The Dark Lord will not be pleased."</p><p>"He has no clue. It will be a rude awakening."</p><p>"One other thing. May I take a crew of students down into the Chamber before they all go home?"</p><p>"Whatever for?"</p><p>"That basilisk was down there for decades. It would have sloughed its skin about once a year. Do you have any idea how valuable basilisk skin is for potions work? I'll keep as much as I think I'll need - for the rest of my life - and we could sell the rest to make money for the school."</p><p>"An excellent idea. You have my permission."</p><p>Hagrid returned, Gryffindor - to no one's surprise - won the House Cup, the students returned home, and the teachers were once again on their own for a few days as they locked things down for the summer break. Lockhart was sent to St. Mungo's, what sympathy there had been for him having died when it was learned that the spell that took his memory had been intended for Ronald Weasley.</p><p>It was only then that Professor Kettleburn informed them that he was retiring from his post as Care of Magical Creatures instructor. So there were two positions to be filled for the following school year.</p><p>They held a roast.</p><p>"I don't want to say that Professor Kettleburn has been here for a long time," McGonagall confided to the assembled teachers, "but my grandmother took her OWL in his class, and even then he was talking about retiring."</p><p>Dumbledore spoke of Kettleburn's versatility. "He could have taught any class better than most of the teachers sitting before me now. A much better professor of Muggle Studies than Trelawney, superior in Flying instruction to Snape, his Arithmancy outclassed Sprout - in fact the most well rounded teacher we have ever had in the school."</p><p>"I was privileged to know students who studied under Professor Kettleburn at the height of his powers," Snape said when it was his turn. "and his lessons were always geared toward the practical. It was he who showed us that Horklumps develop a fondness for wizard ear after the first bite, and that when presented with the possibility of a finger as a snack, a two-week-old Pogrebin is capable of jumping five feet. In fact, until I heard about Kettleburn's class I was totally unaware that flesh-eating slugs were supple enough to squeeze into a hole the diameter of a human nostril."</p><p>Having said farewell to Kettleburn and wishing each other a pleasant vacation, the teachers left Hogwarts for their various homes. Snape arrived at his own cozy house at Spinner's End toward evening of a beautiful June day, glad to have put that year behind him and looking forward to a few weeks of peaceful solitude.</p><p><em>One thing is for certain. Next year has to be better than that one.</em></p><p>27</p>&#13;
