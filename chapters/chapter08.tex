\subsection{Chapter 8: Chapter 8 â€“ More Problems}

\textbf{A Difference in the Family: The First Year - More Problems}

Nana's letter at the end of December contained bad news. The miners union wasn't able to negotiate pay raises, and if talks stopped, there would be a nationwide strike. Russ's dad had never gone out on strike, but Russ knew that if you did, you had no money until the strike was over. He didn't know how his parents would make it if there was no money coming from his dad's work, and he prayed there wouldn't be a strike.

Then the break was over, and the students returned to the school. Once again Lily smiled and managed a hidden wave from the Gryffindor table. Once again Russ took food from the table in the Great Hall at mealtime and slipped away somewhere else to eat it. He'd gotten careless during the break, however, and on Tuesday he left his notebooks and quills in the dormitory during breakfast. As soon as he'd eaten, he rushed down into the dungeons to Slytherin house to retrieve them. As he entered, he heard soft voices in the common room, one of which was Aaron's.

"I said lousy muggles. I think that was why."

"Lousy gets you lice," said Rabastan Lestrange. "That makes some sense. So you think it was the insult?" When Aaron paused, the voice grew harsher. "This time the truth, Wilkes. No hedging."

"I destroyed something. That did it."

Russ set his books on a side table with a thud, and the voices stopped. He didn't want any fifth years thinking he was spying on them. He hurried down the passage to his dorm, then back out again with notebooks and quills wondering if he would be facing a fight in the common room. But the common room was quiet when he passed through on his way out. Lestrange was sitting in front of the fire while Aaron was finishing an assignment.

That evening, a select group of boys began to notice Russ in a way that was different from before. When, just before curfew, he got down to the wall that was the entrance to Slytherin house, two sixth years pushed him aside saying, "Out of the way, half-breed. Purebloods go first." In the common room as he passed by, a seventh year sneered, "We need one dormitory with a cage, just for the mongrels."

Russ pretended to ignore them and went straight through into his own dormitory. Aaron and Evan looked away, Aloysius looked smug, and Mitchell looked embarrassed. Russ said nothing, but went directly to his own bed and pulled the curtains. Something had changed subtly over the Christmas break. Russ had no idea why.

On Saturday, Russ went up to breakfast only to find that outside was a swirling snowstorm. That was a disappointment, since he'd hoped to spend the afternoon practicing his spells under the trees. Now he had to find someplace to be that wasn't already occupied by other students. This would be harder than usual since everyone else was equally castle-bound due to the snow. It was a problem he pushed aside to deal with later, however, since the most important thing that morning was that he would see Lily again.

Russ got to the third floor corridor and their special room first. Lily came in ten minutes later.

"Oh, Severus," she exclaimed as soon as the door was closed, "I had the best Christmas ever!"

"I'm glad," said Russ. "What did you do?"

"We went... you'll never guess! We went to Mallorca!"

"Where's that?"

"It's an island near Spain. It was so nice. The weather was pleasant, and it was sunny most of the time, and the water was so blue. We didn't get to see all the flowers - that'll start in a month - but it was so nice to get away from foggy old Britain. Petunia met this Spanish boy, and mum and dad had fits, but she had a good time."

"How come your parents took you there?"

"Dad's got a new job with a company in Manchester. He drives there every day, and it pays better, so now he thought maybe we could see something of the world. I really like seeing the rest of the world. Maybe soon we can go to France, or Switzerland."

Russ didn't like this idea very much, but he didn't say so. Instead he told Lily how he'd shared the table with the professors, and Dumbledore'd talked to him. Lily was impressed, and that made Russ feel important. They didn't stay together for very long because the next day, Sunday, was Russ's twelfth birthday, and Lily hinted that she had something special planned. They said goodbye, and Russ went looking for a place to practice his spells.

All the extra classrooms on the ground floor were occupied by small study groups. The library was full. Regular classrooms had tutoring sessions, and the Great Hall had clusters of students scattered around it. Russ stood for a few minutes by a window on the second floor looking down at what would have been the ice covered lake if he could have seen that far through the snow. Then he decided to try the dungeons.

The dungeons were a labyrinth of corridors and rooms on several levels going down to Slytherin house and the lake bottom. Russ had explored the corridors, but he hadn't been into all the rooms. Now he decided to look for one, maybe far from the general stairs. It was a terrible thing not to be able to be alone on the day before your birthday.

The problem with the dungeon rooms at these levels was that they were all windowless. At least the Potions room in the first dungeon had little slits of windows up near the ceiling. Below, everything that branched off the stairway was dark.

No one was on the stairs to see him, so Russ lit a Lumos spell and moved cautiously along a passage to his right, further under the hill. A locked door, another locked door, and then a storeroom full of casks and barrels. The fourth door was also unlocked, and inside Russ found crates, bulging burlap sacks, and a table and chair. There were ledger books on the table.

Russ didn't examine the ledgers, since they weren't his. He did move them aside to create space for his own books, and sat down to study. It was immediately apparent that either the chair was too short, or the table too tall, but it was definitely the wrong height for Russ. He stood away from the table and cast a spell to lengthen the legs of the chair, then settled in to study and work on his new spells. The absolute solitude of the storeroom was a blessing.

It was a solitude fated not to last. After only ten minutes, Russ heard a footstep in the passage outside the room, and a moment later the door opened. It was a Slytherin student, a third year girl with dark hair and heavy lidded eyes. Russ had noticed her before, since she was always with a group of the older students, cousins of some kind, lounging in the common room. Most of the others called her Black, but her close relatives called her Bella. She was the one whose sister had recently married a muggle.

"Oh," she said in surprise. "I didn't think anyone would be here."

"I'm... sorry," said Russ, now nervous. "I'll... go." He stood and began to gather his books.

"No, that's all right," she replied. "You were here first." There was a pause as they stood unmoving, Russ by the table and Bella blocking the doorway. "You're one of the first years, aren't you," Bella said finally.

"Yes," was all Russ could manage.

Another pause, then "I'm Bella Black. What's your name?"

"Seve...rus Snape."

She laughed. "You don't look like a Severus. Someone named Severus should be stern and cold. Untouchable. You don't look untouchable. You seem kind of nice. Look, Saturday isn't for studying. Would you like to come to the common room and talk?"

The answer to the question was a most decided `no.' Russ did not want to go to the common room to talk to anybody, especially not this pureblood he suspected of following him into the storeroom. But she was blocking his exit, and he had few options. "All... right," he said. She turned and led the way back to the stairs.

The Slytherin common room was fairly crowded - not surprising considering the weather - but the far corner, shielded from the view of the entrance by the fireplace, was mysteriously empty. Bella went straight to that corner, Russ trailing her obediently. She settled in a comfortable chair, and patted the end of the sofa next to her where Russ sat and waited.

"So, how do you like Hogwarts?" Bella smiled cheerfully.

"It's... all... right."

"How are your classes? Are you learning a lot in your Charms class?"

"Yes."

"What, for example?"

That required a real answer, and Russ paused. "Levi... tation," he said finally.

"Oh, excellent. I love levitation. Show me some. Levitate, let me see... levitate that." Bella pointed to a small bowl of candies.

Bewildered now, Russ let his wand slip into his hand. Levitation was an early first-year spell. Even the most inept wizard could do it by the end of the autumn term. He looked at the bowl, then at Bella. Her gaze was fixed on his wand. Russ decided she would be less suspicious if he could do the spell than if he couldn't, so he pointed his wand at the candy dish, swished and flicked in the prescribed manner, and said, \emph{"Wingardium Leviosa!"} The little dish rose slowly into the air.

"Bravo!" Bella cried, and clapped her hands. Then she pointed to a lamp. "Do that one!" At Bella's command, Russ levitated a lamp, a chair, a small table, and a picture on the wall. Then another third year student came over, one Russ recognized as Rabastan Lestrange's brother Rodolphus.

"Putting your mongrel through his paces?" he asked Bella casually, as Russ let his wand hand fall to his side and stared at the floor.

"You have the manners of a giant, Dolph," Bella responded. "He's no mongrel, just a puppy dog, and he's nice enough to entertain me on dull day. Which is more than you've done. Now go away and leave us alone until you can act like a decent person around others."

"Sure, Bella," Rodolphus laughed. "If you're simple enough to be entertained by a half-breed jester, that's your business." He leaned forward and picked up the candy dish, searching carefully for just the right sweet. "Just let me know when you're ready for something a bit more upscale." Still laughing, he headed in the direction of the wall entrance to Slytherin house.

The entrance was about six steps up from the common room floor. As Rodolphus started up the steps, he suddenly caught his foot on one and fell forward, throwing his hands in front of him to break his fall. The dish clattered to the floor, candy skittering across the stones.

Every other student in the common room looked around at the noise, and Bella was on her feet at once, heading to the entrance to help him. No one was paying any attention to Russ, who moved quickly around the edge of the common room into the corridor and to his own dormitory.

"I thought you were going to let me work on it," Bella said icily when the little group of three met fifteen minutes later in one of the study hall classrooms. "I was doing fine. He was beginning to show off."

"Baby tricks!" Rodolphus scoffed. "You're not going to find out anything that way. You're still on probation, you know. We have an assignment. If you can't produce results..."

"We'll get nothing if he hates us!" Bella retorted.

"No? The only reason we knew anything before today was because he hated Wilkes enough to lash out!"

"And it's still all we know," interjected Rodolphus's older brother Rabastan, who'd been listening to the exchange in silence. "We're no wiser than before." He stopped because the other two were looking at him in a fashion that could only be called gloating. "All right, then. What did you learn?"

Rodolphus chuckled. "I didn't stumble. I was thrown. Something lifted me about two inches into the air so that my foot would catch the step. Don't look at me like that, I know when I've been levitated. Ask Bella."

"He's right, Rabs. Snape kept his head down the whole time, but he was watching out of the corner of his eye. I was watching him. I know he did something, but it was nonverbal. A first year who can do nonverbal spells."

"Well we know that," said Rabastan. "Wilkes already told us he could do nonverbal. Though I wish I'd seen you fall flat on your face." He grinned at his younger brother.

"There's more," said Bella quietly. "He's a dueler." The two boys stared at her. "I mean it," she continued. "He hides his wand somewhere in his robes so he can get it into his hand unseen, in a second. I asked him to levitate that dish, and he had a wand in his hand. But he didn't use it to trip you. He didn't need it."

Rodolphus let out a slow, quiet whistle. "Father will want to know. We're going to have to test this. When do you think we can do it?"

"Not right away," Rabastan replied. "We can't be caught attacking a younger student or we could be expelled. It'll have to be at the right place and the right time. Besides, we're supposed to go slow. We've got a couple of years, and we're not supposed to scare him off."

"I thought you said we were supposed to push him around," said Bella.

"Father said to do what we could to test him, make sure he really has talent, and then hold him. If getting angry is what makes him fight back, then get him angry, but make sure it stays in house. They want him to look for help inside Slytherin, not outside."

"I guess that's your job, Bella," said Rodolphus.

"Yes," said Bella. "That's my job."

"And don't forget," Rabastan added, facing her directly, "you're not in yet. With a sister disgracing herself and a cousin in Gryffindor, you still have to prove that muggle loving doesn't run in the family."

"Don't worry about me," Bella smiled back at him. "As far as I'm concerned, blood traitors don't exist. He'll find he has no one more loyal than me. All I ask is a chance to prove it."

"See that you do," said Rabastan.

\emph{Sunday, January 9, 1972 (the day after the last quarter)}

The next morning, Russ was up early and out of Slytherin house before anyone else was awake. He took his History of Magic book and went up to the third floor corridor to wait for Lily. He wasn't hungry, and didn't want to go into the Great Hall in any case.

"Happy Birthday!" Lily greeted Russ two hours later, and hugged him. "I got up early today just to surprise you, but you beat me up here. I guess that means you didn't eat anything." She was carrying a small basket.

Russ shook his head, then smiled as Lily began to unload the basket. It was full of wonderful things, hard boiled eggs, bread rolls, and sausages, a little flask of tea, another of pumpkin juice, and a sweet roll with a tiny candle on it. This time Lily used a spell to light the candle.

They spent most of the morning together just chatting. Lily did most of the talking, Russ only speaking to encourage her or if he could think of something pleasant to say. He didn't want to spoil Lily's fun by telling her depressing news, and he didn't want her to know how scary the day before had been. He was turning into a very good listener. By the time Russ and Lily were finished celebrating the fact that he was twelve, it was nearly lunch time.

The next day Russ got an owl from Nana. The note contained a brief, belated wish for a happy birthday, and bad news. The day before, while Russ had been celebrating with Lily, British miners had gone out on a nationwide strike. Toby was out of work.

To make matters worse, after that life for Russ in Slytherin house became more and more miserable. It seemed as if everyone was conspiring to make him feel bad. It started with Aaron and Evan.

"Why are you always hiding behind those bed curtains?" Aaron accused him that same evening. "Is there something wrong with you? Do you have some terrible skin disease or something?"

"It's the muggle blood," Evan sneered. "Muggles aren't like normal people. They have tails. Long mongrel tails that wag when they're happy."

"Maybe he's just neat and prissy like a girl."

"Maybe he is a girl."

"How about that, Miss Prissy? Is that why you won't take a bath or change clothes without hiding behind a curtain? Are you a girl? Miss Snape! That's what you are! Miss Prissy Snape." Aaron laughed about his own joke for the next fifteen minutes, until the lights went out and they went to sleep.

In Slytherin house, other students either ignored Russ completely, which was what he preferred, or they acted like they smelled something funny when he was around. Or they went out of their way to avoid touching him, as if he carried a loathsome disease. It was harder to keep clean because the little streams of water he had been using to wash with were frozen in the winter cold, so Russ started to get up around four-thirty every morning to be sure he could wash in peace. He wanted to be sure there wasn't any real smell for them to tease him about.

The only nice person in the whole house was Bella Black. She said `good morning' and asked about his classes, and when she was talking to him, the others left him alone. They never had any long conversations, nor did they talk every day. It was just that when she was in the common room as he passed through, he felt a bit safer.

There was something that Bella had said to him that Russ was thinking about seriously. It was his name. Someone named Severus should be stern and cold. Untouchable. Russ wanted to be cold and unmoved by the taunts. He wanted to be untouchable, to be able to listen to the insults with calm superiority. \emph{If I was Severus instead of Russ, I could do it.} He began to think of himself as this other person, this Severus.

"Severus?" Mitchell was following him out of the Great Hall. Severus turned and waited for him. "Could I ask you a favor?"

Severus regarded him with calculating dark eyes. Mitchell never teased him or insulted him. Mitchell was all right. "Sure," he replied. "What do you want?"

"I need help with some of my classes. I'm not really good at some of the things we have to learn. I mean, Charms and Transfiguration are all right, but Astronomy and Potions - I really need help with Astronomy and Potions. And you're so good at it..."

"Me? I'm barely getting passing marks in Potions."

Mitchell grinned. "You're weird. You're trying to get low marks. Just because old Slughorn can't see beyond the end of his nose doesn't mean the rest of us are blind. You could be top of the class if you wanted to, and do it without hardly trying."

In a way it was nice that someone recognized his abilities. Severus thought for a moment. "All right," he said at last. "I'll work with you on your assignments." The two boys began meeting in one of the unused classrooms on the sixth floor to do their homework and to practice potion-making techniques.

January flowed into February with relative normalcy. Lily's birthday was also on a Sunday, and this time Severus supplied the food and a piece of cake. He wrote frequently to Nana with messages for his parents since the strike was dragging out for weeks, and on February 9, the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency in Britain. Severus was worried sick about his mum and dad, but no one in Hogwarts even noticed that anything unusually was happening. It was like living on two different planets.

The next morning, however, Severus got his first inkling that something was wrong in the wizarding world as well. This came from an overheard conversation between two first year girls, Wilhelmina Alderton, whose father wrote for the \emph{Daily Prophet}, and Sonya MacFusty of the Hebridean dragon-breeding MacFusties.

"It's going to be in the paper today," Wilhelmina was whispering to Sonya. "Father wanted me to know first so no one would surprise me."

Severus paused to rearrange the contents of his book bag.

"Where was it?" Sonya breathed excitedly.

"Right in the yard in front of his house. Not a mark on him. Flat on his back and staring at the sky."

"Wicked. What's Paladin going to do?"

"I don't know. I don't even know if they've told him yet. The \emph{Prophet} always gets the news before the family does."

"His own father. Wicked."

Severus continued up the stairs and into the Great Hall. Paladin. \emph{That must be the Gryffindor first year - what's his name? Wintergreen? That's it - Paladin Wintergreen.} In the Great Hall the Gryffindor table was full, but ominously silent, many of the students glaring at the Slytherin table as if the students there were responsible for whatever had happened. Severus decided to stay for breakfast and find out.

While it was true that Slytherin and Gryffindor never talked to each other except in insult or challenge, Gryffindor did talk to Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, and they talked to Slytherin, so the news was not long in coming. Paladin's father, Pellinor Wintergreen, had been found at midnight, stark dead in his own front garden, cause of death unknown. Paladin was with Dumbledore and would probably be leaving Hogwarts soon, perhaps permanently.

Gryffindor might be stern and withdrawn, but Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin were discussing the news freely. That is, except for a few students at the Slytherin table who were uncharacteristically silent. Silent but with knowing eyes, Rabastan and Rodolphus Lestrange chief among them. Bella Black was also ominously quiet. Severus suspected this was because they already knew what had happened and had no reason to discuss it. Maybe a reason not to.

A quick glance around the table was revealing. Of the other first years, Aaron and Evan were equally quiet, as were Doris Gamp and Claudia Higgs. \emph{So whatever source of information the Lestranges have, the four of them have, too.} Severus wondered what it was.

Later it became known that Paladin had left Hogwarts for good. He was, rumor had it, an only child, and his mother didn't want him far from her now that she'd lost her husband. That meant that the first year boys' dormitory in Gryffindor had only four students in it.

"Hey, it's my little puppy!" Bella said, looking up from her Transfiguration text at Severus, who had just come into the common room. She was sitting right in front of the entrance, as if waiting for him. "I've been hoping to talk to you. Here, sit next to me." She slid aside to make room on the sofa, and Severus gingerly sat down. "Tell me all the news," Bella went on, and though it made Severus nervous, it was also flattering to have her pay attention to him in such a kind way.

"There's... nothing new," Severus said quietly, looking down at his hands rather than at her.

"That isn't true. I've noticed you looking glum."

"It's just... what happened. So... fast."

"You mean about the Gryffindor boy? That's nothing for you to worry about. Besides, you've been worried about something for longer than that. Anything wrong in your family?"

"No," said Severus quickly. "No, they're... fine." For some reason he did not want Bella thinking about his family.

"I'm sure they are. And I'm sure they'll stay fine. Well, I'm glad nothing serious is troubling you." It was clearly a dismissal, so Severus got up and went into his dormitory room.

The next afternoon, Severus noticed Bella and the Lestrange brothers talking earnestly with Mitchell in a corner of the entrance hall. Severus continued on to his classes without stopping, wondering what the three of them would have to do with Mitchell.

Suddenly, in the last third of February, things began to look better. Nana send an extra letter on the twenty-second with a message from Gra that the Russians had sent an unmanned probe called Luna to the moon to pick up rocks. Nana supplemented it with word that the picketing (whatever that was) was called off because a settlement seemed near. The end of month letter came three days early, on Saturday the twenty-sixth. Russ ran up to the third floor to share it with Lily.

"That old miners' strike?" said Lily, wrinkling her nose. "My dad says it's blackmail. He says Mr. Heath says the miners are driving the country to economic ruin with their unreasonable demands. They've asked for a forty percent pay increase."

"Settled for less than twenty-five percent," countered Severus, who'd never heard Prime Minister Edward Heath's name mentioned before without the word `bloody' in front of it. "And deserved it, too, all the years they've been bottom of the pay scale, and them doing the dangerous work."

"That's right," Lily struck back. "Your dad's one of those dirty pit men, isn't he?"

"And your dad's one of them lazy managers sipping tea in a posh office all day collecting money from the hard work of others!"

"Socialist agitator!"

"Capitalist bloodsucker!"

The two stomped away from their meeting place in high dudgeon, and refused to speak to each other for a good four hours. Then, across the intervening tables at lunch, Lily made a sign to meet again.

"I'm glad your dad's getting a pay raise," she said, and there was a note of contrition in her voice. "I guess I forgot all the things you didn't have all those years. Maybe now you can get a television."

"And miss watching the moon missions with you? Never." And so they made up and agreed to be friends again.

Things went well until the middle of March. Throughout that time, Severus and Mitchell studied together and worked together on assignments, but they weren't what is normally considered `friends.' That was more because of what they didn't talk about. They never mentioned their families or their lives before Hogwarts. They never talked about other students. They never discussed their successes, disappointments, or plans. Theirs was a professional relationship, and they talked about their courses and their studies, and nothing else.

Severus found this perfectly normal, since he had never before shared any part of his life with another person his own age except Lily. For him, just having a study partner was a novel and enriching experience. There were occasions when it seemed that Mitchell might want to carry a conversation into more personal topics, but he always caught himself and backtracked before he could be accused of prying. Occasionally Severus saw Mitchell talking to Bella or the Lestrange brothers, but this didn't alarm him. They talked to everyone now.

Then, in March, Mitchell asked the first question. "What part of Britain are you from, anyway?" was the exact phrasing.

"Northern England," Severus replied.

"I'm from Hampshire myself. Never been north 'til I came here. What part?"

This was strange because Severus remembered having been asked this before. It was odd that Mitchell was asking again. "Lancashire," he replied, wondering if Mitchell just didn't recall.

"Merseyside?" Mitchell asked hopefully, and Severus realized the other boy knew something about muggle music.

"No," Severus answered. "Out in the... country."

What followed was even stranger, for Mitchell again asked where, and it seemed to Severus that Mitchell was pressuring him to give the name of his home town. This was something that Severus suddenly didn't want to do. London or Birmingham - that would have been all right, a city large enough to lose the entire school in. But a little Pendle town - that was too close, too vulnerable.

"Just... country," Severus told Mitchell after a moment of interrogation. "I don't... think it has a... name."

"Okay," Mitchell responded, and he seemed pleased.

Several days later the investigation resumed. "You know," Mitchell said, "I've been wondering since September what you did to give Aaron lice."

\emph{I already told you what I did. Don't you remember? Or did you try what I told you and find out it wasn't right?} "I didn't do... anything."

"Come on. You said you just thought the word lice, but that can't be it. At least it didn't work for me. Maybe you were lying and you didn't really give him the lice, but he didn't have lice when we got here. Where else would he get it?"

"I don't... know. Where do people... usually get lice?"

"Nowhere overnight. One minute, no lice. The next minute, lice. I didn't do it. I didn't know who did back then, but I thought it was you. Then you said it was you. Since then I've gotten to know all four of you in the dorm, and the others couldn't have done it. They're not good enough. The only one good enough to do it was you. So I want to know - What did you do to give him lice? And don't tell me you just thought the word `lice' because I know it isn't true."

Severus thought for a minute. "Who do... you want to give... lice to?" he asked.

"Nobody, silly! I just want to know how to do it."

"I don't think... I should tell you. You... might use it to attack... one of my friends."

Mitchell laughed. "Me? Attack anyone? Besides, you don't have any friends but me."

Severus paused to think of an answer, then said, "How do... you know?"

Mitchell looked embarrassed. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. I just never saw you talking to anyone else."

Behind Mitchell, Severus saw Aaron enter the dormitory room. The air was suddenly charged with danger, and Severus immediately began to shut down. He couldn't ignore Mitchell, however. "Just because I don't talk to people in your presence doesn't mean I don't have friends," he said, not noticing Mitchell's sudden amazed stare.

It turned out that Aaron was looking for Mitchell. "She wants to see you," was all that he said, and Mitchell raced out of the dormitory to the common room, only to return twenty minutes later looking depressed and nervous. He lay down on his bed and didn't talk for the rest of the evening. Severus had no doubt who `she' was, and watched Mitchell with a growing feeling of sympathy. It was now obvious that Mitchell was assigned to procure information about Severus. Sympathy did not, however, lead to any sense of obligation or desire to cooperate.

Life, which only a couple of weeks earlier had begun to improve, was becoming difficult again.

\emph{Sunday, March 19, 1972 (three days before the first quarter)}

The third Sunday in March, Severus and Lily met as usual for a couple of hours after breakfast. Their chat was routine, except that they agreed that the weather had improved enough that, although it was still cold, they could resume meeting under the trees on the west side of the lake. Lily left first, and Severus followed several minutes afterwards.

He ran right into Aloysius, Evan, and Aaron. "Funny," said Aloysius as Aaron moved behind Severus and Evan watched his wand hand, "funny how we just saw a Gryffindor girl come out of the exact same corridor as you."

"I don't know what you're talking about," said Severus, his eyes dark and cold.

"That Gryffindor named Evans. She was with you. That corridor has a dead end. The only reason you two 'd be there so long is if you were together. Slytherins don't go with Gryffindor girls. Maybe we have to do something to make sure you remember that." Aloysius was enjoying threatening Severus. It showed.

"Maybe," Aloysius continued, "you should forget her. Wouldn't want anything to happen to her, now would we?"

Severus shook his head, and they let him go.

The next day was Monday, Potions day. This Monday the first years were making Forgetfulness Potions, which would be on their exams. Severus glanced around at the rest of the students as he set up his cauldron. The four Gryffindor boys (now that Wintergreen was gone) and the five Gryffindor girls didn't interest him at all, not even Lily. They weren't the cause of his problems or his pain. It was Slytherin that merited his attention. Even there, it wasn't the girls, just the boys. \emph{Still, if you got in the way, then you got in the way.}

Forgetfulness Potions. Severus smiled to himself. Considering what he'd just been told to do, forgetfulness was an apt and just revenge.

It would be easier if Severus had access to potions ingredients outside of class. Then he could brew things in secret, away from prying eyes. Since he didn't, he had to use this Potions class to make what he wanted, and he had to do it while at the same time making the assigned potion and under the full scrutiny of his house mates.

This time, Severus made no attempt to sabotage his own work. Instead he produced a perfect batch of Forgetfulness Potion in record time, bottled the required amount, and proceeded to divide what was left into beakers, making precisely five batches. With blatant audacity, he crossed the classroom to the supply cupboard, carrying several little vials on a small tray, and selected and measured ingredients from the cupboard into the vials. He was below Slughorn's radar, and he knew it. Slughorn didn't notice him at all.

Back at his table Severus carefully added various combinations of ingredients to each of the five beakers, then bottled and labeled each with care. When he was done, he cleaned his station and looked up. All of the Slytherin students were watching him, as was Lily.

Throughout the day, Severus was constantly aware that he was being spied on. Doris Gamp and Claudia Higgs were one team, and Aaron and Evan another. Aloysius would come by from time to time to talk to one or the other of them, and seemed to be directing the operation. Severus had no chance to get to Lily and tell her what had happened in the third floor corridor. After supper, Severus returned to his dormitory well before curfew to find that the others had been trying to open his footlocker. Trying, but not succeeding, though the reddened, rash-covered hands of Aaron and Evan left no doubt as to their persistence. Aloysius had been watching from his bed. Severus was pleased they were taking an interest in his potions.

Severus then spent a couple of days in the library compiling a list in his small, cramped handwriting. He consulted his notebook frequently, and kept changing the list, apparently oblivious to the students watching him. When finished, the list said

Blue - enhance Ch, Tr,

Green - enhance He, Po.

Yellow - enhance Ast, Hist, DA.

Purple - forget

Red - anti. to pur.

March was coming to an end, and the end of term tests loomed. Students all over Hogwarts were studying madly, hoping to go into the Easter break with the term successfully completed. On Saturday the twenty-fifth, Severus went early to breakfast and waited until Lily came, ate, and left the Hall. He hadn't told her about the threat of the previous weekend, partly because he'd been so closely watched, and partly because they'd already agreed to abandon the third floor and meet outside. After waiting a few minutes, he rose and left the Hall, too.

Aloysius and the third year named Avery were standing at the head of the stairs leading down into the dungeons. When he saw Severus, Aloysius smiled. Realizing immediately what was happening, Severus raced for the oak doors and burst through them into the pleasant spring morning. Lily stood on the lawn in front of the castle, her way to the cliff blocked by the Lestrange brothers, her retreat cut off by Aaron and Evan.

Rabastan's voice wasn't loud, but it was clear. "We're not going to hurt you. We're not going to touch you. We're not interested in you at all. We're just telling you what your own house mates would tell you if they knew. Go to them now, in fact, and ask them to help you meet a Slytherin boy. See what they do. They'll probably thank us." He looked over at the doors and saw Severus standing on the steps. "You can go now," Rabastan told Lily.

Lily turned and ran past Severus into the castle. She was beginning to cry.

Rabastan walked up to Severus and put an arm around his shoulders, steering the smaller boy down the steps and across the lawn toward the cliff. "It's for your own good," he explained gently. "Do you have any idea what the Gryffindor boys would do if they caught you meeting a Gryffindor girl? We're just trying to keep you out of trouble. Your own house is all the friends and family you need at Hogwarts. You should stick to your house."

"I... thought you... didn't like... mongrels."

Rabastan stiffened and looked down, turning Severus so they faced each other. "Don't get cheeky with me. I'm a prefect, and I..."

"What's going on here?" came a commanding voice from the castle entrance. It was the seventh year prefect Malfoy. Rabastan released Severus's shoulders as Malfoy approached them. The others backed away.

"I spotted a couple of your toadies standing sentry duty in the entrance hall," Malfoy continued, his dislike of Rabastan unmistakable, "and then a Gryffindor comes running in, in tears. What do I find outside but every piece of riffraff Slytherin has to offer."

"You'd better watch your step, Malfoy," replied Rabastan. "The world is changing. You don't want to end up obsolete."

"Obsolete? I don't think so. The wizarding world knows the difference between gold and dross. Why are you detaining this first year? What rules has he broken?"

"He's... Nothing."

"Good," said Malfoy. "Then he can go back inside and study. End of term's on us and we want all of Slytherin to get good marks. You," this was addressed to Severus, "get up to the library and work on your assignments."

"Yes, sir," Severus answered, and scurried past the others into the castle and up the stairs, thankful to be saved from Rabastan, but perfectly well aware that the confrontation outside hadn't been about him. It was between Malfoy and Rabastan, and Severus was merely an excuse.

Severus was also aware that the reprieve was only temporary. Malfoy might be able to order Rabastan around while he was outside Slytherin house, but every one of Severus's dorm mates followed Rabastan, and there was no way Severus could escape retaliation unless he obeyed Rabastan and stopped seeing Lily.

It was time to show them that he, Severus, was not entirely helpless. His plan was going forward.

After breakfast on Monday of the last week before the break, Severus opened his footlocker and removed the five little bottles with their colored liquid. Measuring out about a teaspoonful of the green potion into a tiny glass cup, he drank it, then put the vials into his robes. What he managed to conceal was that the bottle he drank from, containing only colored sugar water, went back into the footlocker.

That morning in Herbology, Severus excelled in his test. His answers were long and detailed, and he wrote at least two feet of parchment longer than anyone else in the class. Aaron and Evan watched him carefully, but he affected not to notice. After the class was over, Severus left the castle for a few minutes to get fresh air before his next class. He was reviewing his list, which he held in his left hand.

A sudden breeze blew the paper from Severus's hand. As he spun to seize it before it blew away completely, his wrist was imprisoned in Aaron's fist. About ten feet away, Evan bent to pick up the piece of paper.

"What's this?" Evan sneered. "Are you using memory enhancing potions to cheat on your exams? Bet this would get you detention in a heartbeat."

"Give that... back," Severus whispered hoarsely. "It's... mine, and you have no... right to... look at it."

"I think we do," Aaron said. "If one Slytherin cheats, it tarnishes the honor of all. We're just going to have to be sure you don't cheat anymore." He looked at the steps going back into the castle where Rodolphus Lestrange was watching the little scene.

At a jerk of Aaron's head, Rodolphus came over. "Got a problem?" he asked.

"This Slytherin seems to be using memory potions to cheat on tests," said Aaron. "I think he's carrying them with him. See this paper? He drank something green this morning and then flew through the Herbology test. Isn't that what it says? `Green - enhance Herbology and Potions.' That's what it means, right?"

"Give it... back!" Severus hissed. "It's... mine!"

"It's... mine," Rodolphus mimicked, laughing. "Not anymore, half-breed. Let's see what's in those robes." Aaron and Evan held Severus's arms while Rodolphus frisked him, removing the five vials of potion. "Now you can just finish the rest of your tests without any help from these." Rodolphus tucked the little bottles into his own robes, and strode back into the castle with Aaron and Evan in tow, leaving Severus fuming on the lawn.

Nothing happened during Charms class, but the afternoon was Defense against the Dark Arts. Aaron and Evan swaggered into the class as if they were masters of the world. Each had a little bit of yellow potion in a dosing cup that they covertly swallowed just before the tests were distributed to the class.

Severus was enjoying the situation tremendously, hoping that in other classes at other levels the same scenario was being repeated by other students. It was a treat to receive his paper, glance sideways at his tormentors, and watch the look of blank incomprehension spread over Aaron's face, mirrored by Evan's two desks away. The colored potions were, in fact, subject specific, so both boys were keenly aware of what they were unable to remember.

After an hour's careful writing, Severus turned in a length of parchment that was good enough to merit a relatively high mark without being in any danger of earning an excellent one, thus preserving his own reputation for being good, but not that good. The parchments handed in by Aaron and Evan were blank.

"Hey! Half-breed!"

Severus turned to face Rabastan Lestrange in the fifth floor corridor, the tip of his wand tickling his palm where it lay hidden in his sleeve, ready if he needed it. He was shutting down already. "What do you want?" he asked.

"I want to know what you gave my brother."

"I didn't give your brother anything."

"I've told you before, little first years shouldn't be disrespectful to fifth years. It gets them in trouble."

Bella's voice reached them from down the corridor. "Is my puppy giving you trouble, Rabs?" She approached quickly. "I'm sure he doesn't mean anything by it, do you?"

"He gave a potion to Dolph that made him fail his test in Charms."

"I didn't give..."

"No," Bella laughed, "Dolph took it. He and cousin Aaron. They took it and used it, and it backfired on them. It serves them right, the bullies."

"He set it up. He tricked them."

"No, Rabs, he dangled bait in front of them, and they were dumb little fish and they took it. You've got to teach Dolph not to be so trusting. The world is a dangerous place. He can make it up at end of year exams." Bella smiled up at the older boy, who glared for a moment, then shrugged and left them.

"Thank you," Severus said after Rabastan disappeared.

"It's nothing. I like you. I think you need a friend or two in this place. Like that Mitchell boy. He's nice, too. It's good of you to help him with his homework, and you should let him help you."

"What can he... help me with?"

"I don't know. Things. Got to go. Transfiguration calls." Bella hurried down the stairs, leaving Severus in thought.

"Can I talk to you?" Mitchell asked on Friday as Severus was leaving the Great Hall, his meager lunch in hand. "Not in the Hall. Someplace quiet?"

"First floor... lavatory?"

"Good. Meet you there."

The first floor boys' lavatory was empty. Severus ate his sandwich as he waited for Mitchell, wondering what the other boy wanted. Mitchell arrived about seven minutes later and immediately checked the stalls.

"There's no... one here," Severus said.

"Good. Look, I'm going home tomorrow for Easter break, but there's something you need to know. Don't trust that Bella. She's dangerous."

"I don't... trust her. I don't... like her."

"No, not like that, I mean really dangerous. You've got something she wants. I don't know what it is, but she wants it. She and those friends of hers. I'm supposed to talk to you about her, get you to like her, to trust her, to do what she says. She said if I didn't she'd make me so miserable I wouldn't want to stay at Hogwarts."

"I didn't... know. I thought you were... I wasn't sure. I'm sorry."

"That's all right. Listen. She also wanted information. Like what you can do - the locking spells, and the stuff you can do without saying anything, and how you're faking Potions to make it look like you're no good - she thinks that's all really interesting. I'm supposed to be spying on you."

"Why are you... telling me?"

"I don't want to do it anymore. I don't like her controlling me. After the break it's only a couple of months until the year's over. I think I can take it for a couple of months. I've been teased before. I've got to go. Aloysius is waiting for me in the Hall."

Mitchell left, and the two boys, by unspoken mutual consent, didn't talk to each other for the rest of the day. The next morning the train left for London carrying all the students who were going home for Easter, Lily among them. She and Severus hadn't spoken all week. Once again Severus was left in a nearly deserted school.

The Easter break was, quite frankly, boring. More students remained at Hogwarts than had during the Christmas break, but this was primarily because they were studying for exams and were thus mostly fifth and seventh years. Rabastan Lestrange was not one of them.

Severus was once again alone in his dormitory, and was once again able to use the boys lavatory inside Slytherin house with some freedom since the older students tended to study late and sleep in during the break. He still avoided the common room because it tended to be a congregating point for the others. Mealtimes were rather pleasant as there were enough students so that the teachers remained segregated at the high table, but few enough so that the students spread through the Hall in small groups or studying individually. Severus was able to remain in the Hall to eat without feeling nervous about the presence of others. He did a lot of thinking.

Mitchell had said that he could take being teased and bullied for a couple of months until the summer. Severus wasn't sure if he himself was that strong. \emph{I could take the bullying before, but that was because I knew I had Lily to talk to on the weekends. Can I take not having anyone to talk to for a couple of months? Can I hold out and stay free from whatever Bella's planning? It's only a couple of months, and then we'll go home for the summer. Then Lily and I can talk together any time we want, and we won't have to worry about what Slytherin and Gryffindor think. We'll be back home in Lancashire, and we'll have the whole summer to talk.}

It was a good thought, and Severus resolved to be strong. The promise of the summer would sustain him.

Then the break was over, and the students returned to Hogwarts for the final term of the year. Aaron and Evan arrived on the train on Saturday evening. Lily came on the train, too, and exchanged glances with Severus at supper, but neither tried any further contact. On Sunday, Mitchell apparated in with his father, who left immediately after seeing his son was safely inside the gate. It was the first weekend of the last term, and Severus already missed talking to Lily. He spent the second half of Sunday afternoon in the Library.

Shortly before supper, Severus went downstairs to the Great Hall, but was told by a Hufflepuff prefect that he needed to go to the Slytherin common room where Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Slughorn were addressing the entire house. Severus didn't know if this was normal at the beginning of the final term, but he rather thought not. He went down into the dungeons wondering if he would be the last to arrive since he saw no one else on the stairs. The common room was quiet when he entered, most of the students looking shocked or sad, and several of the sixth and seventh year girls crying.

Mitchell came over to Severus. "It's Malfoy," he said softly. "He's not coming back to Hogwarts."

It took a moment for the information to sink in. "What happened to Malfoy?" Severus asked after a moment.

"His mother - she was killed in a bombing in Northern Ireland during the break."

"Wizards don't plant bombs." Severus was shutting down, his few memories about Malfoy locking themselves away in the vaults of his mind.

"Wizards didn't set the bombs. It was a muggle attack."

"How? Why?"

"She was visiting a cousin in County Armagh. The cousin lived outside Crossmaglen. Professor Dumbledore says there's been lots of trouble among the muggles, and on Friday one group of them set off two dozen bombs all over Northern Ireland. The cousin was so nervous about the violence, she even had a Disillusionment Charm on the house to make it look like a derelict building. Professor Dumbledore says it was just a coincidence that the bomb was put where it would kill Malfoy's mother."

Severus remembered Malfoy putting Rabastan in his place just before the break started, and felt his mouth twitch a little, almost like a smile - one of those bitter half-smiles that wasn't really a smile at all. "They work fast," was all he said, knowing that Mitchell wouldn't understand.

The students went to their rooms, and Headmaster Dumbledore, with Professor McGonagall as Deputy Headmistress, spent some time talking to the girls and boys in small groups in their dormitories about the loss of their friend and senior prefect. When Dumbledore got to the first years, Aaron and Evan did most of the talking - about how nice Malfoy was, and how he was always helping them and giving them advice. Severus, who knew Malfoy had scarcely paid any attention to them at all, except for the day he rescued Severus from Rabastan, sat quietly on his bed, looking occasionally at the walls, but mostly at the floor.

"And what of you, Master Snape?" Dumbledore asked gently before leaving. "Will you miss Master Malfoy?"

"He was... nice," Severus said without looking up, and left it at that.

Bella was first. She came to the dormitory and asked to speak to him. "How're you doing, puppy dog?" she said when Severus went to the door. "I know Malfoy was like an older brother to you."

Severus knew that Rabastan had told her all about the scene outside the castle. He shrugged. "No more than anyone else," he said, jet-black eyes fixed on her face. "You must miss him, though. After all, you knew him a lot longer than I did."

She stared at him. "Why are you talking like that?" she asked.

"Like what?" Severus responded, then turned and went back to his bed. The next day he began haunting the library looking for spells. What he really wanted to do was talk to Lily. She might be able to help him sort things out and see them clearly. Lacking that, he acted on instinct. He had no illusions about the role of coincidence. Malfoy had helped him and thereby made himself a target for Rabastan Lestrange. That meant that he, Severus, was already involved, and the only one left who could orchestrate Malfoy's revenge.

It took awhile to construct the first spell, which involved localized aging. A week later, as Severus slid by the common room on his way to breakfast, he looked at Bella and thought \emph{Phalakros}, then exited through the wall, not knowing if his spell would work since he had no opportunity to test it.

Bella realized what was happening halfway through breakfast when she absent-mindedly ran her hands through her hair. Clumps of strands parted from her head and came away with her fingers. She stared at them in horror, then ran her hand through her hair again. More hair was detached from her scalp. She began to shriek, her initial incoherence gradually resolving itself into the words, `Bald! I'm going bald!" By the time her friends managed to steer her out of the Great Hall, she was in hysterics.

Rodolphus got a silent Schizo spell as he crossed the entrance hall. Instantly, the seams of his robes split, and his clothing began dropping from his body in tatters. In less than a minute he was nearly naked, clutching the shreds of his garments around him as he raced for his dormitory.

Rabastan, being older, required more planning. In the end, Severus decided to wait for the OWLs, and started a series of memory-slowing spells at the beginning of May. Rabastan began suddenly to spend more time in study halls and with paid tutors.

In mid May, Severus paused in a fourth floor corridor at the sound of a familiar voice. It was Rabastan, and he was talking to Rodolphus.

"...says there's no proof he can do anything, and I'm beginning to agree. We've never heard a spell or seen the wand since Bella tested him in January."

"What about at the beginning when we tried to give him a bath? That was him, for certain. And the way he can lock up his stuff."

"So he knows a couple of locking spells. That doesn't mean anything. And they say muggle-borns first know they're magical because they can do things when they're angry or scared that they don't intend and don't understand. Could be the same with half-bloods. He was scared. Something happened. Anyway, except for that, we have nothing but a couple of parlor tricks. They say it's a waste of time."

"I don't know, Rabs..."

"Look, if he's so good, why isn't he getting better grades? Why isn't he threatening us, or defying us about that girl in Gryffindor, or making a power play? Why's he always sneaking around the edges of rooms like he's scared of everybody, and why's he always alone? If I had the kind of talent you think he has, you know what I'd be doing with it! He's a waste of time. We're to drop him."

"What about making my clothes fall off?"

"Geez, Dolph, that could've been anyone! It could've been one of the girls checking you out!" Rabastan was laughing now. "We've got better things to do with our time than test babies. Come on! I'll race you downstairs!"

The two rushed past while Severus flattened himself into a statue niche where they wouldn't see him. It was good news. They were going to leave him alone for a while. It was the best news he'd had all year.

The rest of the term was quiet. It was so quiet that Severus had time to notice that Lily got quite a few owls around exams time. Severus himself passed his exams with good enough grades to be somewhere in the middle of his class - acceptable but not noticeable. The end of term feast was noisy and lasted well into the night, but that only meant that most of the students would sleep on the train back into London. Severus had no intention of sleeping on the train. The train was his opportunity to speak to Lily.

This time Severus wasn't the last one on board, and he managed to find an empty compartment where he was soon joined by two other first years, one Hufflepuff and one Ravenclaw, whose names he still didn't know. It didn't matter, because both dozed the entire trip. About an hour after the train started, Severus left the compartment to look for Lily. He went first to the rear to check by the baggage car.

Lily was already there. "I knew you'd come," she said. "I've missed talking to you ever so much."

"Me, too," said Severus.

Lily told him all about her Easter trip to Kent, and the new wiring in May that allowed Petunia to have her very own princess phone. "Which I'm going to use when Petunia isn't in," she added decidedly. Then Severus told her about Malfoy and his mother's death, something Lily found very depressing.

"It'll be great this summer, though," Severus said. "We'll be able to meet by the river any day we want and just talk. It'll be a lot nicer back home than it was at Hogwarts."

Lily didn't look at him. Instead she looked out the train window. "I'm not going back to Lancashire," she said finally. "Dad's company in Manchester's transferred him to their office in Reigate. They've already moved. They'll meet me in London and we'll go right to Surrey."

There wasn't much else to say. A few minutes later, both went back to their compartments. Severus was already shut down, and remained shut down as he watched Lily greet her family in London. Petunia was there looking smug.

King's Cross was crowded. It took Severus several minutes before he located his mum. She was standing quietly to one side, just waiting. There were no hugs, because there never were. "You all right?" she asked, looking him over.

"Yeah. I'm a survivor."

Eileen nodded brusquely. "And never forget it. Our train leaves tomorrow and your dad's meeting us at Colne. You got your bearings?"

Severus and his mum left King's Cross station, and she watched patiently as he took in the confusion of cars and buses, and the evening bustle of people on their way home from work. Then Severus pointed to the right. "It's over there," he said firmly. "We can use the underground entrance to cross Euston Road."

Eileen smiled. "Good boy," was all she said, but Severus knew she was proud. She let him lead the way down Euston Road to Euston Station where they checked his things, then across to St. Pancras church, where Evensong was under way. They sat during the service like members of the parish, then managed to conceal themselves while the church was locked up. When they were alone, Severus and his mother huddled in a pew in the nave by the light of a tiny Lumos spell.

"Here's your supper, then," she said, pulling sandwiches and apples from her pack. "Now, tell me about Hogwarts."

Severus told her. First about classes, and how he'd kept his marks at a respectable but unremarkable level, except in Herbology because Professor Mullein knew about Nana. She nodded, but was unhappy about Potions.

"It isn't the professors you worry about, Russ, it's the students. Now you've got Slughorn thinking you're mediocre, which is good, but the other Slytherin students know you're faking it. I should've guessed you had too much pride to just botch a potion, but you shouldn't have let them see what you can do. Well, I suppose the damage is done. Next year you can go for better marks in Potions. Be sure you make them think you have to work hard at it. Just don't go showing off in Charms or Dark Arts."

"Yes, Mum," Russ replied.

Early the next morning, the two slipped out of the church and across Euston Road to Euston Station where they got something simple to eat and boarded the train for Lancashire. This train had second-class cars, and Russ settled comfortably into the familiar seat where he didn't feel out of place. He and his mother pointed out things they noticed along the way, chatted more about Hogwarts, ate their sandwiches, and napped a little. The train stopped frequently, and it was early evening before they pulled into Colne.

Toby wasn't there. After half an hour, Eileen settled Russ in the station waiting room with his bag and his books and went out checking pubs. She found him in the second one she entered, not yet too much the worse for wear, and hauled him out while he informed his companions of the hour, "Gotta go see m' boy. Just got back from a la-di-da school, he is. Gotta take the la-di-da shine off 'im. Where is 'e, Leen? Too high an' mighty to come down an' be with 'is father?"

Russ stood as his parents came into the waiting room, judging rapidly how much his dad had drunk and just how touchy he might be. \emph{Not too bad}, he thought. It could have been worse. He waited for his dad to speak first.

"Go on, Toby. Say something to your son." Eileen had already made the same assessments and felt on relatively secure ground.

"Hey there, Russ," Toby grinned. "You didn't grow none. Still knee-high to a midget. That school polish you up all nice and pretty?"

"Don't nobody polish me. If they try, I give 'em what for."

"Let's see how much they taught ya." Toby bent down and stuck out his left hand, palm forward. "Let's see how ya go all fifteen."

Russ looked at the hand and imagined Aaron Wilkes's face. Then he balled his right into a fist and punched out straight into his father's palm. Toby looked surprised, then impressed. "Y' picked up a bit on that right jab," he said, rubbing the reddening palm.

"Told you. Don't nobody polish me."

Nodding appreciatively, Toby turned to Eileen. "There's a fish 'n chip place just down the street. Wha' say we get supper here an' then drive home? It 'd give the boy a chance t' tell me about his battles."

Supper was good, and Russ tucked into his fish and chips with relish. He had to tell his dad three times about the fight in the lavatory where he'd bloodied another boy's nose. He just didn't mention that he'd done it with a spell, and Toby was happy that his boy was a fighter. Eileen was happy that Toby stuck to beer, and just a pint of that.

By the time they finished, it was nearly ten o'clock, and the sun was setting. It would be fully dark long before they got home, and the moon, full and bright, would light the way. Luckily, Toby was perfectly capable of driving the car, and they loaded Russ and his things into the back and set off, arriving about twenty minutes later at the little brick house at the end of the shabby row on the edge of the old mill town where they lived.

On the way, they'd passed through the better part of town, and Russ had noted that Lily's house was dark, the shutters closed, waiting for a new family to move into it.

Things in the Snape family were going so well that Eileen had taken a chance and had Toby stop by the local so that she could run in and get a couple of bottles of beer. With luck, she could keep him home until after last call. Toby'd started to insist that he go in instead, but she told him to stay in the car and talk to his son. "I was with him on the train all day. Now it's your turn."

"You know," said Russ from the back seat, playing his mother's game, "I haven't had the chance to skunk anyone for near ten months."

"You betting you could skunk me?"

"I'm not betting I can't."

"We'll just see when we get home."

Eileen got the beer, and as soon as they were inside their home, Toby pulled out the cribbage board. While Toby and Russ were occupied with the cards, Eileen put her son's things away and turned down the beds. Then she fixed tea in their tiny kitchen and brought Russ a cup. Father and son were neck and neck down the last pegging row, and Toby counted first, pegging out and winning.

"Ya got to give me another chance, dad," Russ insisted, and the two of them played until it was too late for Toby to go to the pub.

In their room, getting ready for bed, Toby mentioned to Eileen, "It's good to have the boy at home again."

It was a good summer, even with Lily not there. With the strike over and settled, Toby had work the entire time at decent pay, which meant he spent less time at the pub except on Friday and Saturday nights. In addition, there were special occasions, the first coming at the middle of July, less than three weeks after Russ arrived home.

"I saw Mrs. Hanson at the market this morning," Eileen told Russ on July fourteenth, a Friday. "She thought you might like t' visit her this evening. Maybe stay over 'til Sunday."

"What for?" Russ asked, not looking up from the second-year Transfiguration book he was studying.

"She said maybe you missed Dr. Who, and maybe you'd like t' go t' Manchester with her tomorrow."

That sparked Russ's interest, for he'd only left his own town a couple of times in his life before going to Hogwarts. "Sure," was all he said, but he was ready to leave well ahead of time. He also had the feeling that maybe this was one of the times his mum and dad wanted to be alone.

Mrs. Hanson had hot chocolate and cookies for him, then Russ soaked in her marvelous tub where he could close the door against the whole world, and at last watched television all Friday evening seated on the floor with his knees pulled up to his chin, for Mrs. Hanson let him, and in her house it was even possible to laugh. The next morning they set out early with one of her borders who drove them to Colne. The trip to Manchester was a long one because for some reason they had to go all the way to Blackburn to change trains, but Russ enjoyed the journey nevertheless.

Mrs. Hanson had a bigger surprise in Manchester. "Didn't you used to enjoy listening to the Beatles?" she asked when they left Victoria Station. "One of their movies is showing here. It's a sort of revival. The one called Help!" And so Russ saw his very first motion picture.

He was fascinated by the recording studios, alpine skiing, Caribbean beaches - and Ringo's vain attempts to fend off villainous ruffians by striking at them with the edge of his hands.

"What's he doing, then? That's not fighting!" Russ scoffed. Certainly not Nel Tarleton's style of fighting.

"I think it's called karate, dear, but he's not very good at it, is he?"

There was no one else to ask about karate until Russ visited his muggle grandmother, Gra.

"Sure I've heard of it. From Asia, I think. I know Toby doesn't think much of it, but your great-grandfather Wensley did. The ships used t' pull into Hong Kong and other parts, and I know he saw some. Your dad and your grandfather always said it was just circus tricks, but Wensley thought they could give a boxer a run for his money."

"Do you have any books about it?"

"Love you, no, dear. What would I be doing with books like that?"

It waited until Toby took them to Blackpool in August. Toby and Eileen wanted to spend time together, so Russ was free to roam the town for two days. He went to book stores and read as much as he could before the shopkeepers realized he wasn't buying and told him to leave.

Russ wasn't impressed by the idea of breaking bricks with your hands. It was the idea that falling was an art, and that an opponent's momentum could be used against him that captivated Russ. When they returned home, he began to spend time out on the moors, practicing falling and rolling the way he'd seen in the pictures. It went well with wand work, and soon he could dive and come up with his wand ready and pointed at his target in one swift motion.

It was much easier than flying on a broomstick.

On the last Monday of the summer, less than a week before school was to start, Russ was out on the moors working on his dueling, incorporating everything he'd been practicing. He came up from a dive and roll to hear his mother's voice behind him. "That's an interesting technique. Where did you learn it."

"From Ringo Starr," Russ replied, turning to look at her. She had her arms crossed over her chest.

"Lovely. Now tell the truth," she said.

"No, it's true. He was doing this karate act in that movie, so I checked on it. Falling and getting out of the way so that you can attack is important."

"Keeping your mind closed and reading theirs is important, too."

"Of course, but I can do both at the same time."

"Show us, then." Eileen opened her arms to reveal that she was carrying her wand. It meant a real training session. Though the spells they used were harmless, they were actual spells. Out here, unidentifiable and away from muggle homes, they could not get into trouble

Russ was already shutting down completely. It was the first thing his mother would check. She had this idea that he would be careless and didn't seem to believe him when he told her that in moments of real danger it happened automatically. Eileen never shut down. She'd told Russ it was because she was imitating his opponents. He sometimes wondered if that was really true.

Eileen started with an Expelliarmus that Russ blocked easily. She then sent out a steady stream of stinging hexes, confusion jinxes, and body-bind curses that Russ parried, blocked and avoided, sometimes using his new techniques, at first awkwardly, then with growing confidence. Within about five minutes, she stopped coddling him and began to fight seriously and in earnest. After twenty minutes of strenuous dueling, with both of them tiring, Russ dove to his left, stayed on the ground when Eileen was expecting him to stand, and disarmed her with a numbing hex to the wrist. It was the first time he'd beaten her in a no-quarter fight.

"Impressive," was all Eileen said, but it was the highest praise she'd ever given him, and Russ was quietly proud. "We'd best get home before your dad's shift is over. Don't want him knowing we've been wand waving now, do we? Just let me check first that you remember all your lessons. Don't want to send you back t' that school with your guard down."

From the time he was a baby, his mother had checked frequently to be sure he never gave himself away, so the moments of intense eye and mind contact with her were as normal to Russ as the air he breathed. Eileen was looking for fear, for doubt and wavering, and she saw none and was content. What she saw was what a potential foe would expect to see - the moor, herself, anticipation of future dueling success, an interest in what was for supper - the things a twelve-year-old should be thinking about. A twelve-year-old whose calm self-control and analytical mind were things Eileen prided herself on.

There were other things that Eileen didn't see - didn't see and didn't miss because she'd never seen them and didn't think to look for them - the moments he shared with others that infringed on her possession of him, like his talks with his grandmothers and his brief laughter at Mrs. Hanson's, and especially his friendship with Lily - the bitterness, shame, and anger at the poverty and blood status that she'd warned him all his life would make him a target, and that his brief stay at Hogwarts had now confirmed - the fierce drive for sheer survival that she'd drilled into him, that inspired his defenses with a preternatural cunning and a talent for manipulation. She didn't look for these things because she didn't know they existed. He hadn't shown them to her and never would. More things closed down automatically than even he knew, and he gave himself away to no one. Not to her. Not even to himself.

In the last days of summer, Russ concentrated on his mother's old second-year books, glad now that he had permission to show more of what he could really do in his upcoming classes. In the early afternoons, he and his mother went out on the moors to duel, and in the evenings he played cribbage with his father. He was rather looking forward to his second year at school, since he had evidence that the Lestrange brothers and Bella would leave him alone, and he was reasonably sure he could control Wilkes and Rosier. And maybe he would find a way to be able to talk to Lily again.

On the morning of Thursday, August 31, 1972, Toby Snape drove his wife and son to Colne and saw them onto the train to London where they would once again arrive at Euston Station, spend the night at St. Pancras, and where the following day Russ would depart from King's Cross Station on the Hogwarts Express for another year, one that promised to be much less eventful than the first one had been.&#13;
