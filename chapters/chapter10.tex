\subsection{Chapter 10: Chapter 10 â€“ Nets}

\textbf{A Difference in the Family: Second Year - Nets}

\subsection{Tuesday, January 9, 1973 (3 days before the 1st quarter)}

She came from behind him as Severus left the Great Hall with his meager supper to go outside and eat. "Hi," she said softly near his left ear. "I remember you. You're Snake, aren't you?"

Severus recognized the voice before he turned to almost look at her. Bella Black, the fourth year student who didn't tease him so much about being part muggle, but asked him to perform like a trained dog. He was amused at her mistake, and didn't correct it. She wouldn't pay attention anyway.

Bella took his silence for assent. "They say," she whispered conspiratorially, "that you're a genius with potions work."

Severus shrugged. Danger bells were ringing in his mind.

"I'm looking for someone who can help me with my potions. I'm so far behind now I don't know how to catch up, and I've got my OWLs next year. I can make it worth your while."

Severus wasn't sure what she meant by that, so he didn't say anything.

"Look, do you want to help me with my potions, or not? It's a little weird talking to someone who doesn't talk back."

"I thought you were the one who wanted me to help you with your potions."

Bella's face tightened in restrained anger. "You little... How dare you talk to me like that, second year. I've offered to let you help me with my class work. I could make you more comfortable in the common room than you've ever been in your life. You don't get snotty with me." Behind her, Rabastan Lestrange was hovering in the doorway of the Great Hall.

"I'll let you know if I ever want to get comfortable in the common room."

Her eyes narrowed. \emph{She's going to slap me.} Severus braced himself for the blow that didn't come. Bella was visibly seething, but seemed to be trying to control herself. \emph{She despises me, but she's forcing herself to stay. Never trust anyone who tries too hard to be nice. They just want something for themselves. They'll use you and throw you away.}

"I still need help getting ready for my OWLs. The offer stays open. You help me with my potions, and I'll take care of you. Life gets better when you have friends."

"It depends on who the friends are."

Bella's mouth dropped open. She spun on her heel and stomped back into the Great Hall, nodding curtly at Rabastan, who stood aside to let her pass. Then he advanced to tower over Severus.

"You really like to live dangerously. I know all about you. You're good with spiders and dog smells, but I can skewer you to the wall and wrap your guts around one of the pillars. I never hurt people that Bella likes, but if Bella doesn't like you, you're fair game. You and I have a grudge. I'm going to make you pay, so you need all the help you can get." And Rabastan followed Bella back into the Great Hall.

Severus watched them go, wondering why, all of a sudden, people like Bella Black and Rabastan Lestrange were taking an interest in him. The back of his neck prickled and a shiver ran down his spine. Alert at once, he glanced around. Above him, looking down from the railing of one of the staircases, was Hogwarts's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. \emph{Did he see what just happened? Did he hear anything?}

Feeling suddenly vulnerable, Severus backed away from the Great Hall, turned, and left the Castle through the main entrance. Tonight, of all nights, there was at least someplace else he could be.

Dumbledore slowly descended the staircase, pondering what he had just seen. The Blacks and the Lestranges were from influential pureblood families that were rumored to be joining the ranks of the former Tom Riddle, who now called himself `Lord Voldemort.' But the boy, he was no more than Eileen Prince's son, and half muggle into the bargain. The Princes were pureblood, but hardly in the same league as the Blacks. Why ever would Bella Black and Rabastan Lestrange be interested in such a... Dumbledore did not really think of any of his students as nonentities, but he knew that Bella and Rabastan would. So why were they after Eileen's little boy?

Severus did not go directly to the lake, but rather took a longer, more roundabout route so he could check whether or not he was being followed. All seemed well, so he picked his way carefully down the slope to the water's edge. Lily wasn't there. \emph{She won't have remembered. A lot has happened since last year.}

Ice rimmed the lake, solid and laced with the marks of skates nearer the shore, thinning to a bare crust over the deeper water in the middle. Something lived down there, just as things lived in the forest, and in the walls of the castle. Mice, rats, spiders, beetles, whole worlds teemed just out of sight and hearing. He thought of things he wanted, but couldn't have. A telescope to look at the moon, a microscope to look at the water, an airplane to visit strange places - anywhere but Hogwarts...

Severus heard the faint slithering of someone coming down the hillside and fingered his wand. Quietly he turned to face the intruder, and it was Lily.

"I'm sorry I'm late," she said.

"Not... a problem. I was looking... at the moon."

She eyed him suspiciously. "What happened?"

"Nothing... happened."

"Yes it did. You're nervous. You only ever talk like that when you're nervous."

He frowned slightly, puzzled.

"Hullo. You're stammering. What happened?"

"A couple of... Slytherins tried... to start a fight. I got... away though. I don't what they wanted. They never noticed me much before." He hadn't told her about the fight with the Lestranges during the break.

"Well, it's gone now, so you must be feeling better. Do you still stammer when you talk to people, like you did in the other school? Besides me, of course."

"No. When I'm really scared, everything gets very clear, and it's like I can see all the details. Then I can say anything."

"Good. That's when you need it. Here, I brought you this." She handed him a small covered dish. "It's why I'm late. A friend in Hufflepuff bribed a house-elf for it."

Severus opened the cover. Inside was a tiny cake, just the right size for two people. Its green and silver icing had red and gold letters on it spelling `Happy 13th B-day.' "Thanks," he said. "It's perfect."

Later, when it was time to return to the dormitories, Severus remembered Rabastan. After December's fight he'd expected trouble with the brothers, but had gotten none. He had no illusions about his luck repeating itself. Sure enough, there in the almost deserted common room were the Lestranges, Rosier, and Avery. Bella Black was not present.

Severus was halfway to the passage leading to his dormitory when Rabastan uncoiled himself from a chair and, pointing his wand at a spot two feet ahead of Severus, sent a stinging hex into the stonework. Rodolphus and Avery blocked his exit through the wall and back into the corridor.

"Thought we'd be asleep by now? Little second years shouldn't be up so late. It's not good for their health."

Severus fingered his hidden wand. His brain was feverishly calculating distances to the center of the common room and to the exit in the wall. Rosier moved suddenly, and Severus's attention flickered to the left. In the instant's distraction, Avery pinned his right arm while Rodolphus extracted the wand. Severus's back was against the cold stone wall, but otherwise he was surrounded. The ease with which they'd cornered him was humiliating.

"Does a baby want his little wand back?" Rabastan stood directly in front of him now. He pulled Severus's wrist from Avery's grasp and twisted, forcing Severus onto his knees. As he heard the sound of Rabastan's belt unbuckling and being drawn from its loops, Severus began to struggle. He was already too familiar with the feel of a belt buckle across his back.

"What's going on here! What do you think you're doing? Let him up! Let him up now!" Bella stood framed in the passageway to the girls' dormitories, her wand pointed at Rabastan. "You disgusting bully! Pick on someone your own size."

Rabastan laughed, and the others drew back. "No harm meant, Bella. Just wanted to scare him a little. We weren't going to do anything."

"You're not now, for sure. Drop his wand. Get out of here, the lot of you. If I find out tomorrow that you've touched him, I'll go after you myself."

They melted back into their dormitories while Bella picked up Severus's wand and knelt beside him on the floor. "Don't worry," she said soothingly. "They won't hurt you. I won't let them."

Severus stood, shaking uncontrollably, and accepted his wand back from her. "Thank you," he said.

Bella smiled. "I told you. I take care of my friends."

\subsection{Up until Thursday January 18, 1973 (the full moon)}

The next morning Bella was waiting for Severus as he left his dormitory. The Lestranges and Avery watched from their fireplace stations like a pack of wolves watching a deer. Bella was all gentle consideration, though, and steered him through the common room with a protective arm around his shoulders. All the while she talked about potions.

"...and then it went all chalky, and for the life of me I don't know what I did wrong."

He knew, and couldn't resist. "You... beat it instead of... stirring it. Never whip... air into a potion like... that."

"There. You see. I knew I was right getting you to help me with this."

It was flattering, even though he had no illusions about the night before. Bella guided him into the Great Hall and sat him beside her for breakfast. She heaped his plate with eggs and sausages, toast with jam and marmalade, a choice of three kinds of tea. He barely uttered the syllable "kip-" and she was reaching for kippers, kidneys, fried tomatoes and mushrooms, bacon... And all the while she plied him with expert questions: How many ortolan eggs to the pound? How do you strain hairs from fresh-pulled badger claws? Which phase of the moon is best for gathering nightshade blossoms? Several members of Slytherin house wished him `Good morning,' students who would have sneered down their noses at him just yesterday.

Lily came in for breakfast, and the shock on her face cut Severus like a knife. He wanted to explain to her what happened, but it was impossible. To make matters worse, she never once looked back at the Slytherin table, leaving with her Gryffindor friends as soon as she had eaten.

Classes were strange, too. Slytherins nodded greetings to him, and no less than three came over during morning breaks to tell him how pleased they were that he was a member of their house. No one whispered `Half-Breed,' no one pulled aside to avoid touching him, no one tried to hit him with wadded up pieces of parchment. Life was pleasant. Life was good.

And all day his mother's voice resonated in the center of his mind. \emph{They're using you. They don't want you, they want your abilities. The instant you aren't useful, they'll sell you. They'll chew you up and spit you out. No one wants just you.}

The next day was double potions, but Severus couldn't talk to Lily during class. Too many Slytherins were watching him. Too many were asking his advice about their potions and copying his movements around the cauldron. To have tried to talk to Lily would have directed their attention towards her, and that was the last thing Severus wanted to do. She had to stay clear of the circus.

And still all that day, as the day before, wherever he went there was Bella Black. And if not her, there was Avery, or Rodolphus Lestrange. It was as if all these former enemies had become his best friends, and the experience was making Severus feel dizzy. Dizzy, and trapped, and exhilaratingly important. For the first time, he began to wonder if his mother had been wrong.

In Severus's own dormitory, things became more relaxed as well. Mitchell Edison spoke to him freely, and the two worked on their History of Magic homework together. Wilkes got sweets from home and passed them around, including Severus as if it were something they'd been doing routinely since the previous year. During the Friday night pillow fight, Rosier noticed that Severus was nervous and tentative, and toned down his roughness. And he didn't tease Severus about it either.

It was, in fact, the first time in Severus's life that he'd related, in a positive way, to a group of boys his own age. He remained wary and ready to shut down at any moment, yet at the same time he was beginning to look forward to evenings in the dorm.

Several times Bella asked him about Potions, so Severus stayed in the common room to go over her work with her. He completely forgot his mother's warnings about making it look as if he was laboring for good marks. The work Bella was doing was still basic, and he was still Nana's grandson. He didn't notice that he was getting a reputation.

During this time, Severus wasn't able to meet with Lily, but somehow, with all the attention he was getting in Slytherin house, it didn't seem quite as important as it used to.

Monday added a new wrinkle to the situation. Severus was making his way along the fourth floor to the library, for once free of attendant Slytherin toadies. It was just after noon, and most of the school was at lunch in the Great Hall. Without warning, a tall, stocky, dark-haired boy about Severus's age stepped from a niche and confronted him in the corridor. It was the boy named Sirius Black. The one from the train in first year.

"If it isn't cousin Bella's little stooge," he said, the pitch and cadence of his voice exactly like that of Rabastan Lestrange. "Aren't you afraid to be wandering about without your guards, Slytherin?"

Severus backed away a few steps. Black was a Gryffindor, but Severus had never before had problems with any of the other houses. "I'm not bothering you," he said.

"Anyone Bella fancies bothers me," the other boy responded. "But I'm still trying to figure out why Dolf doesn't wring your scrawny neck. Then I thought, maybe she doesn't fancy you. Maybe someone a little darker fancies you."

Severus didn't understand what he was talking about, but with every sentence the boy advanced on him, and he retreated an equal distance. Black's plan became clear a moment later when Severus backed into someone else, someone who seized his arms and pinned them behind his back. Severus jerked forward and twisted to the side, but his new antagonist held him too tightly for him to escape.

"Now," said Black, "we're going to clarify a couple of things. First, you meddle in dark arts. We've checked. You use curses all the time. That's going to stop. People who study the dark arts don't last around us. Second, you're not helping Bella. Not now, not ever. Whatever she threatened you with is nothing compared with what we can do. Third, you stay away from the Lestranges, from Avery, from those second years Mulciber, Rosier, and Wilkes. They're mixed up in things that 're going to get you killed. Did I leave anything out?" The last was addressed to his companion.

"It sounded good to me." It was the other boy from the train, Potter. He released Severus by pushing him against the wall. "Remember, we're watching you."

The two sauntered away down the corridor, not even glancing back at Severus, who quickly dodged into the boys' bathroom and leaned against the cool tile. He felt sick. After a minute, he turned on the tap in one of the sinks and splashed cold water on his face. \emph{Why? Why me? Why now? No one ever cared before.} The answer, of course, was obvious. They didn't care about him. They cared about his contact with Bella Black and the Lestranges.

His choices were narrowing. Stay with Bella and be the target of Gryffindors, or defy Bella and be the target of Rabastan and Rodolphus. Life was neither pleasant nor good.

A week had gone by and little more seemed to change. Little that is except that Bella began hinting about people and goals larger than Hogwarts and its classes. She was never direct or specific about her allusions, and Severus was not sure what it had to do with him. The other Slytherins seemed to understand, though.

It was Thursday again, and double Potions in the afternoon. Severus was once again the center of a group of Slytherins while Lily remained surrounded by Gryffindors. There was no contact between the two at all.

At the end of class, as he was nearing the door to the dungeon classroom, Lily suddenly hurried past him. She misjudged the space, knocked into his left arm, and sent her and his books crashing to the floor. "Stupid Slytherin," she hissed as she gathered up her books. She picked up one, realized it was his, and sent it sliding under a table. Then, with a toss of her long red hair, she stormed out of the room.

"Dumb Gryffindor," said one of Severus's house mates, and the group of Slytherins laughed.

Severus picked up his books and returned to his dormitory. There he sat on his bed and opened the book that had gone under the table. In it was a note: `Moon, tonight.'

It wasn't easy slipping away from the Great Hall. Gone were the days when he could grab a bite and leave unnoticed. Now he made an excuse about checking something in the library and escaped before dessert was served. He saw no one in the entrance hall, so he went to and out the great doors and down the steps into the moonlight. The back of his neck was prickling, but it had been doing that all week.

Having watched Eileen Prince's son leave the Great Hall and dart into the night, Dumbledore decided to take a stroll around the grounds. A small set of snowy footprints leading from the entrance steps toward the lake determined his choice of direction, his curiosity increasing when they met another set of footprints descending the hill from the north side of the castle.

From the edge of the copse, Dumbledore watched the two children, red hair and black hair nearly touching as they conferred earnestly in the glow of the full winter moon. He knew the girl, Lily Evans, a sweet muggle-born witch who was slowly becoming one of the most stabilizing forces of the second years. She had a good heart and an honest vision. Professor McGonagall had nothing but praise for her. It was unfortunate that Professor Slughorn didn't have as thorough a knowledge of the students in Slytherin, for the boy, beyond his shyness, was more of an enigma.

Dumbledore coughed loudly and made ostentatious noise as he moved away from the trees. The two by the lake separated suddenly and faced him, clearly discomfited by his presence. "Good evening, Miss Evans. Good evening Master Snape," Dumbledore said cheerfully. "A pleasant night to be enjoying the stars. And the moon." The two students shifted uncomfortably under his gaze.

"It is most fortunate that I have encountered you here, as I have been hoping to exchange a few words with you Master Snape, if I may. I hope you will excuse us, Miss Evans." Lily nodded and said a quick `Good night,' then scurried off in the direction of the castle. Dumbledore settled himself on the same boulder Lily had sat on the first evening she and Severus met in this spot. He motioned to Severus to approach him.

The boy sidled in Dumbledore's direction, but his reluctance was obvious. He kept his gaze fixed on the ground and seemed to shrink inside his robe.

"You know," said Dumbledore gently, "I am generally accustomed to having the people I am speaking to look at me."

His words seemed only to intensify the boy's nervousness. The black eyes darted around the lakeside like a bird trying to escape a cage, looking everywhere, anywhere except at Dumbledore. Dumbledore reached forward and cupped the boy's chin in his palm, thumb and forefinger forcing the young face up and around. No doubt whose son he was, for he had Eileen Prince's long, pale features and lank hair. \emph{It must be his father's nose, though.} For just an instant, the boy's eyes met the Headmaster's then flicked away again, but Dumbledore's expression became suddenly worried.

"I see your mother has been teaching you. She had a difficult time at Hogwarts, and I'm sure she means well trying to protect you from similar problems, but this isn't the way for someone as young as you. Not everyone is going to hurt you."

The boy flinched, and Dumbledore made a mental note to talk to Professor Slughorn about the teasing and bullying that went on inside Slytherin house. "I will be honest with you, Severus." The boy looked up then, and quickly back down, at hearing his name. "I was planning to talk to you about being wary of the friends you associate with, but I think maybe I did not perfectly understand the situation. I should like you to participate in a little experiment with someone else on the grounds. A little secret just between the three of us." Dumbledore rose.

A firm hand on Severus's shoulder steered the boy away from the lake, and a few minutes' walk brought them to Hagrid's hut. Dumbledore knocked politely. The gamekeeper opened the door quickly and was greeting the Headmaster when he saw the student a pace behind.

"Bless me, it's Severus, Eileen's boy," he said.

"Yes, Hagrid. May we come in? The night is still young, and I need to talk to you about something."

An hour later, Severus was dismissed back to Slytherin house, but Dumbledore remained to confer longer with Hagrid. Hagrid was at first insufferably pleased with himself.

"Didn't I tell ya he weren't no Tom Riddle? That child ain't no more looking for power and influence than I am. Maybe less."

"I must confess, Hagrid, that you have proven the better judge of the situation. I fear, however, that I had some time ago reached the same conclusion. It was not the boy's own ambition that I was attempting to curb tonight, but the ambition of others and his utility to them as a pawn. That has now been overtaken by another concern."

"Y're worried about him? In his own right, I mean?"

"Very worried. So worried that I should like to appoint someone to look after him. He is undersized, his health seems fragile, he is nervous and frightened, and he needs to be drawn out of himself. Made more comfortable with the world around him. I should like the person looking after him to be you."

That gave Hagrid pause. "D' ya think I'm the right one for this job, Professor? I mean, I'm more used t' dealing with the animals."

"You care for magical creatures, Hagrid. What more magical creature can you find on this earth than a young wizard? And this one needs a very large amount of care. Not books or classroom work, but real care. He has not had an easy life. I would never have guessed, trying to read him, that he was only thirteen."

"Trying t' read him, eh? Well that's yer business, though I'd like t' know somewhat about it. I can tell ya a few things just by looking up close, though. He's not just undersized, he's seriously undernourished. Needs t' be put on better feed. Then ya usually see that kind of skittishness in a beast that's been mishandled. Beaten maybe. What d' ya know about that muggle Snape that Eileen married? I don't think Eileen 'd beat her son, but maybe his dad."

"I think you are right. I worry now that Eileen may have suffered as well. She was never an open person, never talked about herself. I fear she has passed that trait on to the boy, and made it worse. She has been teaching him occlumency."

"No! Ya don't say so! He's a child! Ya don't lock a child up inside hisself like that and expect him t' turn into any kind of normal human being. What can she be thinking of?"

"I think she means to protect him. But there is some protection worse than any danger. Do you remember what Professor McGonagall said about the boy after the sorting last year?"

"Like reaching fer a bird to find yerself holding a dagger. Thought she was being fanciful."

"No. I fear now she was being quite accurate. I am sorry that I did not follow up on it. We might have been able to intervene earlier."

"What can I do 'bout this occlumency part o' the problem, Professor? I can feed him and tend his hurts, but I don't know how t' deal with occlumency."

"We must get him to express honest emotions, Hagrid. Get him to break through that shell and really feel something, and feel it strongly. Any emotion will do, as long as it is honest. The easiest is anger. Get him to express his anger at what has been and is being done to him."

"Well I don't know. Should I tell him what I'm doing, and why? Or just let him get angry at me?"

"I do not like being devious, but an occlumens's whole intent is to hide thoughts and feelings. If the boy knows what we are doing, he may counter it. I fear we shall have to work on his feelings without telling him our purpose."

The wheel of fortune turned, and suddenly things were back to normal. Or almost normal. The next day it was made clear that the Headmaster had taken an interest in Severus. Not only did Dumbledore bid the boy `good morning' in the Great Hall as he passed to the staff table for breakfast, but Slughorn actually spoke to him the same evening in the common room and inquired about his health and that of his family. Bella and the Lestranges backed away, not wanting attention from Dumbledore, and Severus once again found himself more isolated in Slytherin house.

On the up side of things, no one teased him anymore. At least not in Slytherin. On the down side, he still couldn't talk to Lily in Potions class because he was no longer anonymous in his corner, the other Slytherins turning to him from time to time for advice on their own class work, and Slughorn keeping his eyes more open. Severus and Lily still met by the lake as often as she could escape from her friends without causing comment. Maybe once a week.

Another small problem was the unwanted notice of Gryffindor house. The two Gryffindors who'd accosted Severus near the library continued to let him know that they were watching him, making cutthroat gestures across the Great Hall, or `accidentally' jostling him in the corridors. He contemplated hexing them, but decided it wasn't worth the risk, especially since their attentions were sporadic now that Bella seemed to have forgotten him.

Of course, there were his visits to Hagrid.

The first session was purely medical. In a way it was demeaning, for Hagrid treated him almost like one of the animals he tended. On the other hand it was fascinating, for Severus had never been to a doctor before and the attention was a novelty. And no one would ever know about it except for himself, Hagrid, and presumably Dumbledore.

"Open yer mouth now. There. Yer adult teeth are coming in crooked 'cause yer jaw is too small. Don't know if we can fix that. Ya may have to live with it. Gums are not good, not good at all. More fruit, I think. D' ya like lemons? That may help a lot.

"'T is a pity about the bones in yer legs. Just a tad rickety it strikes me. Arms too, but they don't bear the weight. We can keep it from getting any worse, though. Milk 'll do it. That and lots o' greens.

"Ya've got to grow, lad. Y're way too small for yer age, an' I don't think it's in the blood. I think it's in the rearing. Meat's what ya need. Lots o' good, red meat."

A prescription was sent to the house-elves for a change in diet. Aside from a general direction to eat more, Severus was to be given a special glass of milk with each meal, and his intake of meat, fruit, and green vegetables was to be monitored. It was a blessing that the others were paying less attention to him now for, overall, it was a little... embarrassing.

And then there was the matter of the irresistible force and the immovable object.

"Now, lad, if ya'll just lower the top half o' yer gown so 's I can look at yer spine and back muscles..."

Severus froze, doors slamming and sealing. "No," he said quietly. "I don't think that will be necessary. My back is fine."

"Well I think I need to be the judge of that. What with the rickets and all, I need t' check fer curvature and alignment. Just part of the examination."

Severus turned to gather up his cloak and robe, and in doing so moved three feet closer to the door. "My back has never bothered me. There's no reason for you to be concerned."

"Well it ain't concern so much as doing my job. Part of it is checking yer back."

"I have class now. It will have to wait until another time. I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will arrange it for us." And he was gone back to the safety of the castle and his house.

"And I'm as sure as I'm standing here that the reason was he has something on his back he don't want me t' see." Hagrid accepted a glass of firewater from Dumbledore and downed it with enthusiasm. "It ain't that he don't want me touching it. He don't want me seeing it."

"Scars, perhaps? You did say the skittishness of a creature that has been mishandled. The scars of a beating, maybe? Or of many beatings? And from his father, or his mother, or both? At least he is not being beaten here. We have some time to sort this out."

"Just so 's you know, he ain't said one word 'gainst either dad or mum."

Dumbledore sighed. "They seldom do," he said.

The spring advanced, life went on, and the owls came again, his grandmother's among them. This time there was no extra scrap of paper inside the blue envelope, just the message.

"May 14. It's going up May 14." Severus told Lily that evening. "I have to watch."

"You. Won't. Be. Able. To. See. It! I told you last time, and I was right. What can you see here of a launch in Florida?"

"It isn't the seeing. It's the..."

"Being part of it. All right. I'll watch with you. At least it's in the evening this time instead of the morning."

\subsection{Tuesday, May 15, 1973 (2 days before the full moon)}

The day after the launch, Severus got the second owl.

Lily found him standing on the edge of the lake, his face tilted to the moon, now almost full. "What happened?" she asked.

"Do you know that the Saturn V rocket has never failed on a mission? Never."

"So something happened. What happened? There wasn't anyone on that rocket. It wasn't manned. No one could have died."

"The sun shield is gone. The solar panels are damaged. It hasn't got any power."

"Are they scrubbing the mission? Are they just going to leave it there?"

"No. They're still going up. It's just been delayed."

"Then why are you so upset? No one's died, the mission is still `go.' "

"Don't you see? So many things can go wrong. Don't you remember the Russians put up a space station a couple of years ago? They called it Salyut. Everything was fine until the cosmonauts came back. Then something happened to the reentry vehicle, and they... died. Out there in space. The Skylab crew could die, too."

"Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't think about that."

"No, no. It isn't sad. The cosmonauts saw things no one else has seen. They were living their dream. They died doing something the world will remember forever. How can you find a better way to die? There are so many worse ways to go."

They lay on their backs on the grass at the verge of the lake, looking at the moon. "Would you like to go like that, like the Russian crew?" Lily asked.

"Doing something I wanted to do? Oh, yes! It's the perfect way to die."

Talk of death made Lily uncomfortable, for she could see no `perfect' way to die. "If that's the perfect way to go, what would be the worst way to die?"

For Severus, that answer was easy. "Like Professor Binns. Stuck in Hogwarts until you die, and even then not being able to leave. Never going anywhere. Never doing anything. Never exploring anything new. Can you think of anything worse than ending up a teacher at Hogwarts for the rest of your life?"

Skylab was a success. An owl arrived nearly every day with news of repairs and space walks. Severus and Lily now had a whole new vocabulary that included `solar sails' and `extravehicular activity.' One disappointment was that they wouldn't be able to keep vigil together for the astronauts' return, for that was scheduled for the very day that they were to leave Hogwarts and return to London.

Then came final exams, and the whole school hunkered down with books, notes, wand practice, and late night potions. And finally it was over. Another year at Hogwarts. Just a week left to clear out cupboards, pack clothes, exchange addresses, be given the marks on the exams, and get ready for the train back to King's Cross Station from Hogsmeade.

Two days before they were to leave, Professor Dumbledore stopped Severus in the entrance hall on his way from dinner. He held a legal-looking envelope in his hand. "If I may, Master Snape, this letter arrived for you from Hogsmeade this afternoon. I trust it is not bad news, but if it is you must feel free to come to me for any assistance."

Severus said, "Thank you," but instead of either looking at the letter or continuing to Slytherin house, he walked slowly up to the first floor and sat on a staircase near the hospital wing. It was certain that no one would bother him there. He examined the letter; he had already recognized his mother's hand in the address. Then, with a shrug, he slipped his thumb under the flap and opened it.

Inside was a second-class ticket for the Saturday morning train from Euston station in London to Colne, Lancashire. A hurriedly scribbled note said `We'll meet you at Colne.'

\subsection{Friday, June 22 to Saturday, June 23, 1973 (the last quarter of the moon)}

The change in plans meant a change in packing. Severus sought out Professor Slughorn for permission to leave his books and other school paraphernalia locked in Hogwarts for the summer. He took with him only his battered Gladstone bag, which was more than sufficient to hold his robes after changing on the train. That, and a few other clothes and small personal items.

The morning of departure was a flurry of activity for most students, but Severus waited quietly in his dormitory until everyone had gone to breakfast. His bag was only half full, since his muggle clothes were on under his robes. Hearing the bustle die down, he glanced once around the room, stood, and walked out, holding the bag close to his left side.

Arriving at the Great Hall, he settled at the end near the doors, separate from the others, and slipped the bag under the table, its latch unfastened. From time to time as he ate breakfast, he would sneak a roll, meat, fruit, into the bag. He didn't want to take too much, but it had to last for two days.

The ride to Hogsmeade was different from his first year. Severus 'd said goodbye to Lily the evening before. It 'd been short and simple - have a good summer, and we'll see each other in September. On the train he made his way to the last car and, finding no empty compartment, preferred to sit in the aisle by the door at the end, even though he knew Lily wouldn't join him. Nearing London, he took off his robes. Underneath he wore a pair of gray trousers and a cotton shirt. Shoving the robes into the bag, he replaced his cloak with a gray sweater, a little worn at the elbows.

The train pulled into London and spilled students onto the platform, jostling, laughing, hugging, waving goodbye, greeting their families... Once more Severus waited until most had left, then he followed the remaining students through the barrier and into King's Cross station. From that moment he was indistinguishable from any other muggle child of a respectable working class background.

One unexpected surprise was that Lily was still there. She was talking with her parents and a skinny blonde girl who Severus realized was a fifteen-year-old Petunia. They seemed upset, and Lily seemed to be resisting them, glancing back from time to time at the entrance to the Hogwarts platform. When she saw Severus, she smiled, pointed at a newsstand to her left, and abruptly ended her argument with her parents by turning and walking toward the exit, leaving them puzzled in her wake. Severus approached the newsstand. The article in the evening paper was small, but on the front page. The astronauts' splashdown had been without mishap.

One of the things that Severus hated about London (and this was, after all, his fourth time in the metropolis) was the traffic. Outside the great tan brick bulk of King's Cross and its red brick neighbor St. Pancras was a bedlam of cars that careened through a huge open transit area in apparent total chaos. Severus turned right out of the main entrance and joined the evening rush to the underground station. He had no intention of boarding a tube train since he had no money, but the underground was also a convenient subway passage to the other side of Euston Road.

The walk to St. Pancras Church was not long. Evensong was in progress, and Severus had no trouble finding an empty pew. Most of the pews were empty. The tricky part was avoiding being seen as the church was closing down for the night. Still, no one really expected a thirteen-year-old boy to be spending the night in the church, and so what they didn't expect to see, they didn't see. It was, in fact, easier alone than it had been with his mother the year before.

The next morning when the church opened for morning prayer, he simply crossed Euston Road to Euston train station. The worst thing at this point was thirst, but handfuls of water from the tap in the men's room were enough to keep him going. He wandered around the station for a couple of hours, watching the people and reading the fronts of the newspapers until it was time to board his train. He did that at the earliest possible opportunity, and was able to get a seat by a window. He was pleased at how smoothly things were going.

The journey to Colne lasted eight hours. Basically it was boring as he had nothing to do. Severus thought about Apollo 17 and Skylab, about Bella and Rabastan, about Dumbledore and Hagrid, and about possible reasons why his mother hadn't been able to meet him in London. Mostly he thought about Lily and decided two things. The first was that he could pretend he was talking to her, and then he wouldn't feel so lonely. The second was that he still couldn't tell his parents about her, even though now she lived so far to the south. It didn't do for management and labor to fraternize.

It was early evening when the train pulled into the station at Colne, and Severus was the only person left in his car. He stood quietly on the platform for a few seconds, then saw his mum. She waved, and he lifted a hand in response. Together they went onto the street where his dad waited by the car. It was the old black car, held together in places with rope, but he knew every broken spring in it. He'd even helped keep it running.

"Did ya give 'em what for?" his dad asked.

"Whupped 'em every time."

"That's my boy."

The long northern evening stretched out before them as they left Colne, and the stark silhouette of Pendle Hill loomed to their left, backlit by the sun, whose red glow suffused the omnipresent smoke and haze with a crimson and vermilion worthy of Dante. It was less than a quarter hour's drive to the small mill town where the Snape family lived. No one talked during the ride. Severus was home.

The brick house at the end of the row was dim inside, but they lit no lamps. Summer was no time to be wasting money, and the sun would be enough light for a couple of hours yet.

"What'll ya be wanting for supper yer first night home, boy? No expense spared. Anything that fancy school can give you, we can better yer first night home."

"Fish and chips. And chocolate taffy," Severus replied.

His dad roared with laughter. "Did I tell you, 'Leen? No fancy school's going t' spoil him. Did I call it? Did I?"

"You called it, Toby." Eileen smiled at her husband and her son, and got the bag out of the icebox. "Your dad picked it up before we drove to Colne." Plates, cups, and forks were laid out, with the fish and chips, salt and vinegar, tea for Eileen and Severus, and a bottle of small ale for Tobias. They set to the meal hungrily, not talking for several minutes.

"Anything else ya missed, boy?"

"Double skunking m' dad. Can't do that at Hogwarts. None of them puddings knows nothing."

Tobias Snape laughed again and went to the sideboard. From it he pulled a battered deck of greasy cards and an ancient cribbage board. Great-grandfather Snape had been a seaman, and cribbage was a family tradition.

Father and son played three full games, Severus winning one and Tobias the other two. It had by then grown so dark in the small house that they could hardly see the pips on the cards. "You're tired boy, best go to bed. Tomorrow's Sunday. We'll have a good old time."

There were two bedrooms upstairs. The back one had long before been divided in two to form a tiny sleeping area and a storage space. Undressed and in bed, Severus listened to his parents downstairs. Funny that in all these years it had never occurred to them that he could hear them.

"The boy's growed, Eileen. Wrists sticking a mile out his sleeves. He's growed, and he'll need new togs."

"He won't need them yet, Toby. We've got all summer to figure it out. We can piece it out, a bit here, a bit there. We can sell the old things. He can use my old books next year; we won't have to get any of them new."

"We got to keep the expense down. We can't afford them things. Look, I know I promised to be good, but I got to think this out. I got to go out and think on it."

Severus heard the door close and knew his father was off to the local boozer. It was his fault. He'd taken food from Lily, from Bella, from Hagrid. It was all that extra food. That was why he'd grown, and that was why his father had gone out to get drunk. \emph{I can't do anything right. Everything I touch turns out wrong. Now I've ruined it for Mum, and I've only just got home.}

He did not go to sleep that night.

Severus's bed stood next to the window where he could look out at the night. So many nights watching, estimating the time by the moon and stars. Now it was `last call.' Now the final patrons left and the doors were locked. Still his father didn't come home, which meant he was with his mates and a bottle.

Not until after two o'clock did Severus hear the uneven steps on the cobbles and the rattle of the doorknob. Eileen heard it, too, and crept quietly down the stairs. Before she reached the bottom, the door slammed open.

"Where's m' boy? Where's m' son? Come back from that big fancy school! He should be 'ere t' talk t' his dad! Russ! Get down here an' keep yer dad company!"

"Shh, Toby. Come to bed. He's tired, he's asleep. You can talk in the morning."

"Get out th' way, woman! That's m' boy. Needs t' be learnin' a man's business..."

"Please, Toby. Not so loud. You'll wake him. Wake the neighbors."

"A man's job! Not some jumped-up college pudding, fancy..."

"It's late. Better in the morning..."

"My son! Not some witch's brat!"

"Toby!"

Severus heard the sound of the blow and his mother hitting the wall. He was up and halfway down the stairs in a second. Eileen was standing against the wall, her left arm up to protect her face, while Tobias advanced on her, fist raised.

"Russ!" Eileen yelled. "Get back upstairs! Stay out of this!"

"You!" Tobias roared. "Come back from yer fancy school, think you're better 'n everyone! Takin' a man's wage out his pocket fer fancy clothes! Get down 'ere! I'll show ya what for!"

Tobias charged up the stairs, but Eileen lunged for his arm. "Toby!" she screamed, "Russ!" Tobias turned, unsteady, her weight dragging on him, and struck her backhanded across the mouth, sending her into the wall again. Severus turned and ran for his room, to his bed where his wand was hidden under the pillow. From the top of the stairs he pointed it at his father's distorted face and hissed, "Stupefacio!" A bolt of red light struck Tobias, and he fell forward to lie unconscious on the steps.

Eileen and Severus stared at each other over Tobias's limp form. Both were breathing hard. "What," Eileen forced out, "do you think you're doing? Give me that thing. Now!"

Dumbly Severus handed her the wand. It'd all been so fast that he still wasn't sure what had happened. His father lay sprawled on the stairs, beginning to snore. But he had done that. He had taken his wand and used it against his father. He was no better than Rabastan or the Gryffindor bullies. His mother's anger was righteous and justified. A deep sense of shame began to fill him.

"You'll get this back when you go to London in September," Eileen said. "Now see if you can help me get him into bed. If you're lucky, he won't remember anything tomorrow."

They had managed to pull Tobias up onto the upper landing when they heard a flurry of wings against the sitting room window. "Oh, no," whispered Eileen, and she hurried down the stairs to admit the owl. The letter was brief to the point of rudeness. An underage wizard had used a stupefying spell and was now in danger of being expelled from school. Both he and his parents were warned that any repetition of this behavior would result in disciplinary action.

"That's done it," said Eileen to the house in general. "Now the Ministry of Magic is watching us." She waved the letter in her fist as she came back up the stairs. "You know what your dad 'll do if he finds out the Ministry's got its eye on him! You had to go for the wand!"

"I'm sorry, Mum, I didn't think..."

"Obviously not!"

"It's just that I got so used to having to be ready, and sometimes you don't have time to think..."

Eileen patted her son on the shoulder. "So you didn't whup 'em every time, eh? That's all right, Russ. I forgive you the fib. It made your dad happy. Let's get him to bed now. Won't any more owls be bothering us tonight. But you and me have to work on this fighting thing. You have to decide in a second whether to react or not react, and you can't afford to get it wrong. We start Monday after your dad goes to work."

The next morning Tobias was sick with a fierce hangover. He knew from the bruise on Eileen's face that he'd done something the night before, but he had no memory of what it was. Both Eileen and Severus acted as if nothing had happened, and soon Tobias accepted that they were probably right.

The summer quickly settled into a routine. Tobias left early each morning for work while Eileen and Severus practiced until noon honing his reaction skills. Then, depending on what she could take in, Eileen sewed, washed, or charred in neighboring villages, while Severus explored the surrounding moor country, collecting seeds and roots for his potions. Friday evenings Tobias spent with his mates, and was the worse for wear Saturday mornings, but aside from that he kept his promise to Eileen about being good. Except, of course, for the last day in July when they got word of the eighteen killed in a cage accident at Markham No 2 Colliery in Derbyshire the day before. Every mining man in the district was angry and drinking that night and Eileen, forewarned by a neighbor with a radio, sent Severus out with a pillow and a blanket to sleep in the area behind the kitchen before Tobias got home.

And of course, Eileen looked for clothes. Fortunately the cloak and biretta could still be worn. The robe was loose enough, but getting too short, so Eileen invested some of her hard-earned coin in black cloth to add a strip about the bottom. Some of the same cloth provided plackets and gores in the gown, as well as a band around the waist to add length. Her seamstress work was so expert that it was hard to tell that the robes had been reworked.

The other clothes for a growing boy - shirts, trousers, sweaters, underwear - were harder to come by. There were charity shops and church poor-bins, and some things Eileen got as castoffs from the families she worked for. In the end it was all good, sturdy, serviceable working-class cotton, gray and dingy from too many washings in mineral-hard boiling water and cheap soap, but solid and durable. And Tobias didn't have to lay out his own wages, so familial peace was maintained on that score.

One day Eileen and Severus went to visit Nana, his witch grandmother. It was an all-day expedition, for they had to hike over the hills and moors to another town. Nana had a modest cottage on the edge of town with an extensive garden. Bees hummed, butterflies fluttered languidly, and you could practically hear the earthworms plowing up the soil. The brown owl Nelson lived in a little hutch by the rear door and kept the pigeons away from the insect life.

Nana, many generations back, had the blood of Katherine Hewitt in her, and was renowned in the district for her potions. She had three cauldrons bubbling in her kitchen the day her daughter and grandson came to visit, and hauled Severus inside at once to try his newly learned and supposedly improved skills. Love potions sold best, and sleeping potions were easiest to make, but the healing potions were Nana's greatest gift. Bone-knit and headache remedies, salves to stop bleeding and poultices to draw stings, syrups for coughs and catarrhs, Nana supplied the whole region. She and Severus roamed the garden, snipping buds, plucking hips, scraping twigs, stripping grass heads. He could learn more in one day from his grandmother than Slughorn had taught the whole last term.

The `other one,' Gra, had been married to grandfather Snape and, though she never said so, Severus had the impression that she was pleased to be a widow. Gra loved puzzles. She had a jigsaw puzzle, a different one each visit, in progress on the dining room table, and so they could never eat there. Gra kept Britain's most extensive collection of murder mysteries on her bookshelves, and an equally impressive collection of real-life murder case clippings stored in a small filing cabinet. When Severus was six, she had him working on the fox, goose, cabbage puzzle and, as he grew, the logic problems became more complex.

Visiting Gra was always amusing, for she knew a little of everything that was happening. She kept newspapers for months and extracted the ones with the most interesting stories to hold for her grandson. Everything about the Apollo missions was in her house, as well as the Skylab program, but most recently she had begun collecting articles on something called deoxyribonucleic acid. Severus was entranced, and carried an armload of newspapers and magazines home with him. Suddenly, his passion was biochemistry.

The letter came from Hogwarts, and Eileen began preparing Severus for his third year.

The first thing they did was break open the boxes in the half storeroom. Every book on Severus's list was there, though in a edition at least twenty years old. They pulled them out and dusted them, then experimented with ways to cover them so as to hide their age. Eileen thought of white wrappers, but Severus suggested newspaper and magazine clippings arranged in themes. That way, if anyone challenged him on the covers, he could challenge them back on their knowledge of the world.

One of the things they pulled out was Eileen's old `Advanced Potions' book. "You can't take that with you, it's a sixth year book," she chided him.

"But Mum, I was using this when I was nine," Severus responded, turning the book over to look at the signature he'd written on the back cover four years earlier. That was the year that Nana 'd told him he was still half a Prince on his mum's side, a wizard, as well as a Snape on his dad's. He'd been so proud of his Prince blood that he'd inscribed the name on the book's cover. Today, at the advanced age of thirteen, the inscription seemed childish.

Still, he tucked the potions book, with all the notes and inscriptions he'd started making, into the box of books he was taking with him to Hogwarts. He had no doubt that something in it would prove useful in the coming year.

Tobias started talking about going to Blackpool once as a special excursion, but both Eileen and Severus regarded this as a potential disaster, especially since the wage settlement from the strike the previous year was being eroded by price increases, and money was an issue. In the end, they talked him down to a Sunday picnic on Pendle Hill. That afternoon, Severus stood at the top of Pendle Hill and looked down on all of east Lancashire. He thought of Katherine Hewitt and the others that had been hanged with her, of his seaman great-grandfather, and of all the Snapes and Princes in his life. He had a past that had nothing to do with Hogwarts. It was no backwater of ignorance and grinding poverty, but a rich heritage of individual strength and initiative. He could stand up to any Black or Lestrange in the world.

His mother didn't go with him to London at the end of August. He was thirteen, and a man who could take care of himself. Though he carried more than just a Gladstone bag, it was still his job to transport everything from Euston Station to King's Cross, and to get himself on board the Hogwarts train. His parents drove him to Colne for the Friday morning train to London. He took with him his lunch, supper, and breakfast, plus enough money for a locker at King's Cross to store his extra baggage. The night at St. Pancras was like spending an evening at a favorite and preferred hotel. On Saturday, September 1, he crossed through the portal to platform 9 3/4 and was on his way back to Hogwarts.

That weekend, Tobias Snape was drunk two nights in a row and gave Eileen a black eye.
