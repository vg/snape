\textbf{Too Much for Granted: Answers and More Questions}

\emph{Saturday, November 2, 1996 (moon at last quarter)}

The first Saturday in November dawned chill but sunny, with the pale, cold sun of the north as winter neared. Perfect Quidditch weather. Everything seemed normal as Snape made his way to the Slytherin changing room. The new announcer was Smith from Hufflepuff. \emph{I thought he was one of Hufflepuff's Chasers. Who's going to announce when Hufflepuff plays? Well, at least it should be more pleasant than having to listen to a blatantly partisan Gryffindor announcer.}

Then the Slytherin team came into the changing room, and Snape's eyes widened in surprise. He was expecting the new Chaser, since Vaisey 'd been injured in practice the day before, but now Malfoy wasn't there either. "Why the change in lineup?" he asked quietly, and Urquhart, the new team captain, shrugged.

"Malfoy's sick today. We just replaced him with Harper."

"Very well. You should clear it with me ahead of time, though. I'm going up to the castle to see if Malfoy's all right. You have a good game. Keep Weasley off balance and Potter away from the Snitch and we should be fine. Good luck."

For some reason, Snape knew that Malfoy wasn't really sick, so he wasn't surprised that the only Slytherin player in the hospital wing was Vaisey. He then hurried down to Slytherin house, but Malfoy was in neither the common room nor his own dormitory. Worried now, Snape started a search of the whole castle, certain that Malfoy was taking advantage of the fact that everyone was watching the game to further his own plans with regard to the Dark Lord's task.

There was no sign of Malfoy anywhere on the grounds. Snape started back to the Quidditch pitch just as the cheers and screams of the crowd announced that the game was over. He hurried down the hill, passing Filch going the other way. A moment later he saw Malfoy near the Slytherin stands. \emph{What's he doing out here?}

Before he could speak to Malfoy, Snape was distracted by a crash and the sound of splintering wood. He made for the scene immediately, to find that one of the Gryffindor players had crashed into the announcer's booth. Smith had fallen with the impact and lay on the ground, covered by wood. Sprout had hurried over as well. McGonagall was headed onto the field to accost the guilty party.

Snape sent another Hufflepuff team member, up the hill to alert Madam Pomfrey while Sprout attended to her fallen student. Smith was dazed, and had received several cuts in the fall. It also looked as if he would develop some bad bruises.

Sprout was livid. "Idiot Gryffindors! If she doesn't take at least fifty points from them and put that crazy fool on a month of detention, I'm going to Dumbledore! That house is a menace to the whole school!"

Flitwick came over then to see if he could help. Together the three teachers got Smith onto a stretcher and started to move him away from the pitch. McGonagall joined them, and Sprout turned on her to vent her wrath.

"When are you going to start controlling those hooligans of yours! They could have killed him, crashing into the booth like that! I've half a mind to demand that Gryffindor be disqualified for the whole season. Blatant, unwarranted, vicious, irresponsible..."

"I am so sorry, Pomona. I'm afraid she was upset by his announcing. She felt it was unfair to the team and especially to her brother."

The other three teachers regarded McGonagall in silence for a moment. Finally Flitwick spoke up. "So now they know how we felt all those years with Lee Jordan announcing. I don't recall that anyone on our teams ever attacked Jordan."

Snape nodded in agreement. "You have to admit, Minerva, Gryffindor is the most violent house in the school. None of the other houses resort to physical attacks with either the frequency or the brutality of Gryffindor. You lost your Seeker and both your Beaters last year because of violence."

McGonagall seemed surprised at the unity of the other three heads of houses. "That was Umbridge trying to..."

"No, Minerva," said Flitwick. "That was Potter and the Weasley twins responding to heckling by beating up Malfoy. They need to learn that you react to words with words, not with fists, and not by endangering lives and health."

Looking over at the stretcher, which Sprout was again moving up the hill, McGonagall nodded. "I've already taken the points from them. The girl will go on detention for a while. I hope the boy is all right."

"I think it's all minor damage," said Snape, "though I'll feel better after Pomfrey's had a look at him."

It was only at supper that Snape realized he'd been so distracted that he'd forgotten to ask Malfoy where he'd been and why he couldn't play. \emph{It will have to wait until Monday, I suppose.}

As soon as the crowd of students began to leave the Great Hall, and the teachers made sure that no one from Hufflepuff was going to take issue with the behavior of Gryffindor and start a fight, Snape returned to his office to gather a few things and then leave for Lancashire.

Once again, it was a very enjoyable evening. Snape browsed through his great-grandfather's collection of grimoires and histories, looking for every mention of specific artifacts and noting them down. He was particularly interested in the items that corresponded to those on the tarot card, but did not overlook the possibility that his assessment had been in error.

Snape also made a list of everyone he could recall having met at Twelve Grimmauld Place. If the Dark Lord was going to ask him for a name, he wanted to be sure he could at least narrow the list down, to show he'd been working on the problem. When he concentrated on the first couple of times he'd ever gone to the house, it suddenly hit him, and he was surprised he hadn't thought of it at once.

\emph{Mundungus Fletcher. He's a member of the Order. If anyone in that group is a thief by vocation, it's Mundungus. You'd better hope Mr. Fletcher, that the Dark Lord never asks, because yours is the name I'll have to give him. Pay attention to Dumbledore's warnings, and stay hidden.}

The next morning, Snape again apparated to various archives around the country, looking for anything that might tie families to artifacts and anyone to the names Gaunt and Peverell. He didn't bother with anything recent, assuming Dumbledore had that already covered, focusing instead on the earlier information - nearer to the time of the founders themselves.

It was a thoroughly confusing day. Snape spent hours trying to make sense of all the Williams, Hughs, Roberts, Adelizas and Margarets, not helped by the fact that the documents were mutually contradictory. Or maybe it was just gaps in the records that made it look contradictory. Nothing profitable had come out of the day.

The one thing that attracted Snape was the coat of arms said to belong to Peverell of Nottingham and Peverell of Devon. Looking remarkably like the arms of the Earls of Chester, it had three gold sheaves of wheat on a blue background, surmounted by a horizontal gold bar.

What was intriguing was that the bundled wheat sheaves reminded Snape of the sign hanging outside the 'Three Broomsticks' inn in Hogsmeade, as if the wheat was intended to represent broom heads, or the brooms intended to be sheaves.

There was not time to think about it now, however, since he was due at headquarters. Folding a copy he'd made of the shield and putting it in a pocket, Snape apparated to Birmingham.

The laboratory was a mess. Cupboards and drawers were open and their contents disarranged. The cabinets had been emptied and refilled haphazardly. Beakers were disordered as if shoved aside in a search. Yaxley appeared right behind Snape, clearly having watched for his arrival. "Bella," was all he said.

Without a word, Snape turned and rushed downstairs, putting in a request to speak with the Dark Lord and waiting, angry and agitated, in the antechamber. After a few minutes, Bella joined him. They did not greet each other. Half an hour later, they were admitted.

"You have a complaint, Potions master."

"Lord, my laboratory has been invaded and my work ruined. Ingredients and materials are scattered all over the place..."

"Is anything missing?"

"I don't know, Lord. I'll have to do a full inventory. It will take hours."

"How has your work been ruined."

"Potions were brewing that should not have been disturbed. Temperatures that needed to be exactly maintained dropped. The potions are ruined, I can tell by the colors. Why was this permitted?"

Snape gasped as pain suddenly licked the edges of his brain. "Do you question our orders?"

"No, Lord."

"Our head of Field Operations expressed concern that there was an area within this building that was accessible to only one person. She had cause to believe there were things brewing there that had not been authorized. We permitted the security sweep."

"Did she find anything unauthorized, Lord?" Snape looked directly at Bella as he asked the question.

"No, she did not."

"Lord, I have several weeks of work that has to be redone. Some of it was for the clinic, to use specifically with field operatives that are injured. Will Field Operations now accuse me of withholding medicines they need for a cause that was beyond my control?"

It was Bella's turn to gasp, and she quickly replied, "No, Lord. We won't hold him responsible."

"Lord, give me permission to seal the laboratory so that only I can enter."

"How will you do this?"

"I don't know yet. I need to experiment with shielding. Lord, I would bring the spell to you before using it."

Bella burst out angrily, "That means no one would have access while he's at Hogwarts! What if we need the things inside?"

"What if Yaxley could also enter, and could control the shielding?"

"You have our permission."

A few minutes later Snape told Yaxley what they had to do. Yaxley was skeptical. "How do you make a shield only two people can go through?"

"I don't know, but I need to try." \emph{If Hogwarts can do it with owls, I can do it here.}

Snape sat in a comfortable chair in Dumbledore's office, staring into a goblet of mead.

"The problem is, none of it fits. The whole story of the founding of Hogwarts is unraveling in a morass of anachronisms. I was always told, at least by the teachers here, that Hogwarts was around a thousand years old - more now - but I don't see how that's possible. Did you know that 'slithe-rinc' was Anglo-Saxon for "cruel man," but that Salazar is a surname from northwest Spain that didn't exist until several centuries later?"

"I can appreciate where that would hamper your research."

"I thought maybe it could be a later corruption of a similar-sounding name, so I even managed to find out that Sal-asaru is Anglo-Saxon for rope or necklace of hazelwort, and since hazelwort is also called snakeroot, it seemed appropriate, but that really is stretching things."

"I see..."

"And then it's almost impossible to tell when the other two families, Peverell and Gaunt, enter the picture. If the thousand years is true, then the castle could have been started as early as Malcolm I or as late as Kenneth II here in Scotland, which in England would be anywhere from the reign of Edmund I to Ethelred the Unready. But even Ethelred died a good half century before the Conquest."

"And this is important because..."

"Both Peverell and Gaunt become established under William the Conqueror. Peverell is from western Normandy and Gaunt from Belgium. How they may have married into the families of any of the founders has so far escaped my investigations."

"Ah, well. Not a lot to go on."

"Rowena Ravenclaw is an interesting one. 'Hraefn-clawu' means not only raven claw, but crab claw as well, so I'm also taking the tarot card of the Moon and the sign of Cancer into consideration. She came up with the idea of a constantly changing floor plan, you know. If there was any place in the castle that continuously changed, it would probably have been initiated by her. Do you know of such a place?"

"I may have heard of one. I shall have to check it out."

"It would help if I knew what I was looking for..."

"Ah, Severus. If we always knew what we would find, life would become very dull."

"I just want to go in the right direction."

"You are doing quite well, actually."

Snape glared at Dumbledore for a moment. "There is an unrelated problem. I need to know how you let the owls in."

"Through the defenses? The shields are calibrated to their bio-signs."

"Which are isolated how?"

"Well, until the early 1990s we used a crude physiological calibration, but now we employ a non-Mendelian DNA sequence..."

Snape rolled his eyes ceilingwards. "Sir, how do you know so much and so little at the same time?"

"I beg your pardon?" Dumbledore peered over his glasses.

"We adjust the shields using mitochondrial DNA, but you don't know who John of Gaunt was."

"I look into what is useful to me at the moment. I do not need John of Gaunt on a day to day basis. I need DNA. You have no idea how long it took us to discover that muggle scientists already had the information we needed to adjust the shields. This is why I need you. You have a background in muggle knowledge that will help you find these things faster. I would never have thought to look for Kenneth II or Ethelred the Unready."

"Remind me again. What do you need?"

"Artifacts and other trivia about the founders, and their relationship to other families, especially Gaunt and Peverell."

"I'll keep looking."

The DNA part was relatively easy. Genetics was one of the things that had fascinated Snape as a schoolboy, and he'd kept up on its advances over the years. Yaxley wasn't too sure about taking tissue scrapings from inside his mouth, but relaxed when Snape showed him it was just a little swab that didn't hurt at all.

The tests took a few weeks, but with a mind spell or two they were at least at the head of the line. Meanwhile the two started testing ways to calibrate a shield.

With the permission of the Dark Lord, they did most of the testing in Snape's own home, using the back storage area/potions lab. It was smaller than the one at headquarters, but otherwise similar, being also on an upper floor. The shield had to surround the room, but allow others to work unhindered in adjacent areas.

Snape realized immediately that there was more than DNA involved. Owls didn't wear clothing. Whoever passed through the shield had to do so fully clothed and possibly carrying items. Recalibrating was a cumbersome business that required them to remove the entire shield and replace it.

"If we do that, we might just as well have a simple shield that we raise and lower at need, but I don't want that. I want one where I can enter the lab and the person walking beside me can't."

Yaxley nodded, knowing full well who the person walking beside Snape was likely to be, and not wanting her around either. "Tossing something through the door isn't likely to hurt much, is it?" he asked.

"Not unless it's a bomb, in which case we'd have a lot more to worry about than a laboratory."

"So we can let objects through, just not people or spells?"

That, of course, made the task easier. Snape regarded Yaxley for a moment. "Why did they remove you from the Cardiff branch anyway?"

"Bella convinced the Dark Lord that my heart wasn't in the work. The numbers supported her interpretation. Besides, they wanted something to give to Rabastan, and he wanted Glasgow. Nott was willing to support Bella against Malfoy, so they moved me out and him in."

"The sons aren't friendly at Hogwarts. Now I know why."

"You never were very involved in the politics of headquarters, were you? Always up at Hogwarts, or messing around in the lab, or giving defense lessons. You taught me back in the old days. Just a boy you were then."

"I hope it did you some good."

"Got me out of a tight spot so I wasn't around when Bella was looking for a team to go after the Longbottoms. I didn't have a chance before to thank you for that."

"Don't mention it. Glad I could be of help."

With regard to his outside research, Snape decided to concentrate on the family of Hugh Peverell of Devon. Devon was, after all, the home county of a high percentage of Britain's wizards. Ottery St. Catchpole was in Devon, home of Weasleys, Lovegoods, and a plethora of others. Godric's Hollow itself was not far from them. Devon seemed a likely candidate for further study.

November passed slowly, a frustrating and fragmented month. At headquarters, Snape was constantly busy in the laboratory as Field Operations kept up a steady series of attacks across the Midlands. Bella was in her stride now, ringing up success after success in a string of small but tactically valuable raids against the Dark Lord's enemies. The Ministry under Scrimgeour seemed powerless to respond. \emph{The Daily Prophet} announced arrests, and brought great glee to headquarters in doing so, for none of the named arrestees were actually Death Eaters. The fact that the failures came during the watch of Scrimgeour, a man Snape disliked intensely, was the only good thing about it.

Recruitment was up, too. More and more of the marginal wizard families, those who had never benefited from the policies of the Ministry and who resented the prosperity of their muggle neighbors, were coming into the Dark Lord's ranks. Enough, in fact to from new cells in Hampshire and Leicestershire.

This turned out to be a good thing on a personal level because the Dark Lord sent Fenrir Greyback out to proselytize among the werewolves. Lunches in the cafeteria were much more pleasant without the prospect of Greyback's loud, crude voice or the wet-dog scent that permeated the air where he was.

Life at Hogwarts was something of a juggling act, as Snape was doing the jobs of one and a half professors. The Dark Arts curriculum had not been taught properly since... Snape hated to admit it, but not since Quirrell had taught the course. The students Snape inherited from Lockhart, Lupin, Crouch, and Umbridge were a spotty group across the board - very knowledgeable about some things and woeful deficient in others. Snape frequently had to go back to the very basics, even with his NEWT classes, in order to proceed with the course material.

Then there was Slughorn, who was continually asking Snape to do something for him. Slughorn seemed to feel that the fact that Snape remained in the office near the Potions classroom meant that Snape was Slughorn's errand boy. Snape was repeatedly promising himself that he would fling the next request back into Slughorn's face, but then he would watch the enormous Potions master huff and puff up the stairs to his own rooms and would relent. \emph{If I made him do all his own work, he'd have a heart attack within a week.}

Meanwhile his other research led Snape to stories of swords and hats, of belts, capes, rings, wands, lockets, bracelets, gloves, books, and furniture. Most of the claims of authenticity of these reputed artifacts of the founders had already been proven false, but others were still possible. Snape deeply regretted that Ollivander was not available, for if anyone knew the whereabouts of the founders' wands it was him. And Fortescue's knowledge of medieval history would have been invaluable. Dumbledore was of no assistance either, for Dumbledore was absent from Hogwarts most of the time now.

The most disturbing thing, however, were the thoughts that seemed to bubble up, unbidden, from the depths of Snape's mind. Thoughts about Phina and Sirius and Potter, but mostly thoughts about Lily.

\emph{It has to be her patronus. It has to be. 'Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.' Everyone thought they were just silly nicknames, but they were the animagus forms. Lupin's a werewolf, Pettigrew's a rat, Sirius was a dog... prongs are the antlers of a stag, and Potter's patronus is a stag, so that would have been James's patronus, too. If Lily's was a doe, it must mean her feelings for James...} Whenever he reached this point, Snape began to shut down automatically. The dangers of walking that path were too great, and Snape was beginning to hate the form his patronus had taken.

The other train of thought was equally distressing. Why now? Nothing in his relationship to Lily's memory had changed. The dream voice of the pink she-wolf taunted him - \emph{'Not be. Feel!' I don't want to feel. Everyone I feel something for dies. Not only can't I stop it, I'm the one that makes it happen. I took Narcissa to Nana's home. I gave the prophecy to the Dark Lord. I told Sirius of my suspicions about Potter's destination...} Snape forced himself to think of Sirius's face in the green flames that night. \emph{It's all right. I didn't want him dead. At least I don't bear that burden. It's because Sirius felt things too strongly. This 'love' is a dangerous thing.}

There was one thing he could do for the memory of Lily and Sirius. It was a thing he'd promised Dumbledore long before, under duress - a duty, a charge, a commitment made by the living to the dead that their deaths not be in vain. He could watch over the boy they'd both loved, however unknowing and ungrateful that boy would be about it. Whatever else happened, Snape would see to it that Harry Potter survived.

Then December came, cold and snowy. The DNA results came back, allowing Snape and Yaxley do the final work on the shields, which Snape planned to present to the Dark Lord and then install over the Christmas break.

At Hogwarts Snape now worried about the behavior of Malfoy, who was letting his class work slide in all his subjects, and was disappearing for long stretches of time. Occasionally Snape saw him down by the gates with Filch and wondered if Filch was letting the boy out to visit Hogsmeade, but since Snape never saw Malfoy enter or leave, he didn't confront either of them about it.

Malfoy continued to avoid conferences with Snape. From time to time he'd be summoned to Snape's office, and always found a reason not to go. Normally Snape would have forced the issue, but knowing that Malfoy reported everything to Bella made him cautious. He didn't want her to accuse him again of harassing her nephew, and so Snape waited patiently for the chance to catch Malfoy where they could talk privately.

As the term neared its end, Snape received an invitation to Slughorn's Christmas party. He could think of only two reasons why he'd been invited - because Slughorn invited all the teachers, and because Snape had to be kept happy so that he would continue to handle the Potions supplies.

Large parties were a bore. In all his life, Snape had only been to one big party that was fun - on the night he became a Death Eater. Considering how that had worked out over the years, it was probably a good thing that there'd been no other fun parties.

It was rather interesting seeing who among the students had been invited. Potter, of course, and Granger... \emph{Does she remind you of Lily, Professor?...} but no Malfoy. The perils of having a father in Azkaban. A few years ago, when Lucius was on the Board of Governors for Hogwarts, Malfoy'd have been on the top of the list. \emph{Sic transit gloria mundi.}

Slughorn's office was garishly done up as a Bedouin sheik's tent, and the guests from outside included a Who's Who of former students. Authors, musicians, a vampire... \emph{Was he a student, too, or just a friend of a friend?}

Passing through the throng, Snape caught a snippet of Slughorn's booming conversation. "...a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sibyll - why even Severus -" and suddenly he was seized and pulled resisting into the little group. Slughorn had clearly already had a tad too much to drink, and threw a beefy arm around Snape's shoulders.

"Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus! I was just talking about Harry's exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!"

A tiny suspicion suddenly raised its head above the level of subconscious thought, for this wasn't the first time Slughorn had mentioned Potter's hitherto undiscovered talents. Snape eyed the boy speculatively. "Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all."

"Well, then, it's natural ability! You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death - never had a student produce finer on a first attempt. I don't think even you, Severus..."

"Really?" Snape knew that Slughorn had never truly noticed his potions ability, and he also knew, having experimented with the Draught of Living Death at the age of twelve and having noted his improvements in his mother's old Potions text, that no one had ever equaled him. Except Lily, of course, after he taught her how to do it...

Potter was reciting his courses in response to Slughorn's questioning. "All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror," Snape said, allowing sarcasm into his voice. \emph{One who jumps to the wrong conclusions and arrests all the wrong people as a result. You'll do very well in the Ministry.} It was gratifying to note that his promise to keep Potter alive did not carry with it the obligation to like the boy.

The conversation floated on to other things, and Snape was looking for escape, when Filch dragged Malfoy into the room. Malfoy insisted he was trying to gatecrash, but Snape suddenly knew he'd been out of the Slytherin dormitories for other reasons. The gate crashing was a cover. \emph{Idiot boy! And why is Filch salivating over the prospect of disciplining Malfoy? Maybe they aren't working together after all.}

Slughorn allowed Malfoy to stay, but as the boy began to flatter the professor shamelessly, Snape realized he now had an opportunity to talk to Malfoy where he couldn't make excuses or escape. "I'd like a word with you, Draco," he said suddenly.

Slughorn protested. "Oh, now, Severus, it's Christmas, don't be too hard..."

"I'm his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be. Follow me, Draco."

It was a matter of a moment to find an empty classroom and push Malfoy into it. He pulled the boy over to a desk near the door and pointed to it. "Sit down, Draco. We need to talk." Malfoy did as he was told. Snape himself sat on the desk across from it.

"Now, Draco, you and I need to have that little chat."

Malfoy looked sullenly at the floor. His attitude was irritating and disrespectful. Snape went directly to the point.

"I have been trying to speak with you ever since that little fiasco with the cursed necklace back in October. If I had known you were planning anything so stupid, so liable to both fail and be detected, I would not have allowed you to proceed. What you are attempting is too important, your success too vital to your whole family... You cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled..."

"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?"

"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it."

"Who suspects me?" In his anger, Malfoy looked directly at Snape, who took advantage of the eye contact to try reading him. "For the last time," Malfoy insisted, "I didn't do it, okay? That Bell girl must've had an enemy no one knows about - don't look at me like that! I know what you're doing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work - I can stop you!"

And he was right. Snape's somewhat limited legilimens ability was running into crude but effective blocks. Crude because they were so obvious. Effective because he couldn't get past them. "Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you occlumency, I see." \emph{And the fact that she's willing to risk the Dark Lord's wrath is very telling.} "What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?" \emph{Shall I tell you what he does to people he suspects of trying to control what he can see?}

"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in!"

\emph{Why have you decided to go into Bella's camp? Don't you know she and your father are enemies? Or have you decided that you don't want a father who gets himself thrown into Azkaban? Watch out, Draco. No one is as close to the Dark Lord as Bella claims to be.}

"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? Had anybody else failed to come to my office when I told them repeatedly to be there, Draco..."

"So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!"

\emph{Is that an accusation that you believe me to be working for Dumbledore? Dear Bella's influence again.} "You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things."

"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!"

"Listen to me. I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco..."

"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, and I'm doing it, I've got a plan, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!"

\emph{He's beginning to crack. Things aren't going well, and he's scared.} "What is your plan?"

"It's none of your business!"

"If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you..."

"I've got all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!"

"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes..."

"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!"

"Keep your voice down! If your friends intend to pass their Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder..."

"What does it matter?... it's all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts..."

"It is an act crucial to success... Where would I have been all these years if I had not known how to act? If you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle..."

"I've got other people on my side, better people!"

"Then why not confide in me, and I can..."

"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!"

"You are speaking like a child! I understand your father's imprisonment has upset you, but..."

Then Malfoy was stomping angrily out of the room. Snape watched him go in frustration, wondering what else he could have done to get Malfoy to talk to him. Then he slipped quietly into the empty corridor and headed for Dumbledore's office, for Dumbledore had returned in time for Christmas.

"He won't admit to the necklace business, and he won't accept my help. Bella's got him believing that I work for you."

"Well, you do."

Snape just glared at Dumbledore. "He hasn't given up, and he refuses help. So it's probably Malfoy's assessment that he's failed that drives the Vow. He's very frightened, so he may be coming up on some kind of a deadline. He did let slip that something's taking longer than it should."

"Poor Draco. He's going home for the Christmas break. I hope that he returns to us whole and healthy in January."

"If anything happens to him, it'll be all over headquarters in a heartbeat. I'll try to watch out for him."

"You have to. You took a Vow."

"To the best of my ability. I just love loopholes."

Christmas break started, and two days after Christmas Snape and Yaxley were ready to present their shield to the Dark Lord for his approval. They arrived to a somber and subdued headquarters.

"I don't think you want to go down there," the clerk at the sign-in desk said when the two started for the stairs.

"Why not?" Snape was suddenly apprehensive.

"Bit of unpleasantness. I wouldn't be related to the Malfoys for all the firewhisky in Scotland."

Downstairs they found Bella in the antechamber. She looked sick. A few minutes later the door was opened by a messenger who seemed surprised to see Snape. "He wants you now. All of you. How did you...?"

Snape shook his head as the three of them entered the interview chamber. All was dark except for the circle of light where Draco knelt, clutching his stomach. Narcissa was lying on the floor moaning. Bella started at once for her, but Snape seized her arm, trying to communicate wordlessly that her action wouldn't help her sister.

"Ah..." the Dark Lord's voice hissed across the room. "A trio of faithless servants. We honor them with our trust, and they all betray us."

"Lord," Bella cried, "I am your most faithful servant. I'd never betray you!" She collapsed writhing on the floor.

"Have you protestations as well, Potions master?"

"Lord, I am weak and ignorant. If I have failed you, I deserve to be punished."

"Do you speak of Hogwarts to this other servant?"

"No, Lord. It is not part of his tasks."

"Nigel, you will go. This does not concern you after all." Yaxley bowed and left in silence, not glancing at Snape as he went.

Muscle cramps spasmed through Snape's stomach and legs, felling him to his knees, and searing fire flared in his right arm so that he cried out.

"What is your job, Potions master?"

"To make potions and medicines for your servants," Snape gasped, "to train them in defense, and to report to you what goes on at Hogwarts and within the Order of the Phoenix."

"And it did not occur to you that we might wish to know that Dumbledore had been injured."

There was no good answer. Understanding now why the Dark Lord targeted his right arm with flame, Snape closed his eyes and gave himself up to the pain.

Awareness returned slowly. Snape had no idea how many minutes the torment had lasted, but Bella, Narcissa, and Draco hadn't moved. Draco looked as if he were about to be sick.

"Rise, son of a dishonored house."

Draco clambered to his feet, sweat beading his forehead. "Yes, Lord," he stammered.

"Twice you have failed, and our patience wears thin. You know what you must do."

"Yes, Lord."

"Take these worthless women and leave our presence."

Draco helped his mother and aunt to rise, and the three of them left the interview chamber. Snape lay very still, not daring to move.

"Kneel and face us, Potions master."

His arm still burning with pain, Snape struggled into a kneeling position and obediently made eye contact with the Dark Lord. After a moment he was released from the probe.

"When did Dumbledore receive this injury?"

"I don't know, Lord."

"It was not the cause for which you were summoned to him in July."

"No, Lord."

"Had he already been injured at that time?"

Not knowing which answer would be more acceptable, yet not daring to hesitate, Snape said, "No, Lord."

"When you saw him again in August, had he been injured?"

"Yes, Lord."

"Rise. You will speak of this to none. When you return to Hogwarts, remember that young Malfoy has a task. It is not for you to know what it is. You will see that no one hinders him."

"Yes, Lord." There was silence. "Lord, forgive my boldness, but there was another task."

"Speak."

"Yaxley and I have finished the shielding that we promised you. We came today to present it to you."

"Send for Yaxley."

"I swear I don't know how you do it. You take that kind of punishment, and then you talk calmly of routine business as if nothing had happened."

"I was not calm. I've no idea what gives you that impression."

"Maybe it's the quiet voice, the steady hands, and the attention to minute detail." Yaxley chuckled. "Macnair had some fascinating theories about you, you know."

"Macnair's an idiot."

"I don't know. You take it so much in stride. By the way, thank you."

"For what?"

"Keeping me out of it."

"You weren't involved."

"Others would love to cast blame randomly. You don't. Thank you."

Just at the end of the Christmas break, Snape was called once more into the presence of the Dark Lord. Anger frosted the air, and Snape braced himself for more punishment.

"We have asked you before about Slughorn. Does Dumbledore treat him with honor? Is he consulted and sought after for counsel?"

"No, Lord. Dumbledore still pays little attention to him. He is not given any special place or honor."

"We wish to interview him, but Dumbledore keeps him from us. Does he ever leave Hogwarts?"

"He went at least once into Hogsmeade, Lord."

"Advise us should he do so again."

"Yes, Lord."

Snape had been away from Hogwarts for most of the Christmas break, something he hadn't done for years. It felt almost like September when he returned, rather than January, because he'd been gone so long. He went up to the seventh floor immediately to see Dumbledore, but the headmaster was once again away from Hogwarts.

Descending the stairs again to the dungeons, Snape paused on the fifth floor. \emph{The Library. Here I've been poring over muggle books and never bothered to check the Hogwarts Library. I wonder...}

The students who'd gone home for the break were arriving the next day, and the Library was thus empty. Snape glanced briefly at the history section, realized he had no idea where genealogical material, if any, might be shelved, and went looking for the librarian, Madam Pince. She steered him toward a far aisle where students seldom went, the works there being neither necessary for classes nor in any way forbidden.

As the librarian turned to go, Snape remembered something Dumbledore had said months earlier. "Madam Pince," he asked, "would you happen to have something on Beedle the Bard?"

Pince gave him a strange look, then returned after a few minutes with two books which Snape added to the four he was taking from the family history section. In those few minutes, all Snape's attention had shifted from her, Beedle, or anyone else, for on the little flap of parchment glued onto the inside cover of one book, the flap on which the identity of borrowers was recorded, Snape had noticed a familiar name: T. Riddle.

Gathering up the books, six in all, Snape hurried to his office in the dungeons.

Once in the dungeon rooms, Snape settled himself in his reading chair in the bedroom with the books piled on the small table beside him. He took the book that the Dark Lord had borrowed as a student and stood it on its spine in his lap, then gently allowed the book to fall open of its own accord. Knowing the Dark Lord, Snape imagined he would study a valued text over and over again. If there had been one place where it had been kept open for long periods of time, the book might open again to that spot where the spine was now weaker.

It did. It opened to a section with several pages of family tree charts covering about ten generations between 1400 and 1700. The charts detailed the intermarriages between a number of families from the counties of Stafford, Warwick, Worcester, Hereford, and Shropshire. There were names Snape recognized, and names he didn't, wizarding families having predictably died out and been replaced by muggle-born families in a regular progression over the decades.

It amused Snape to scan through these charts, and in doing so he noticed a number of tiny penciled ticks that followed certain bloodlines through the generations, multiplying ancestors as it went. \emph{Could these have been made by the Dark Lord as a teenager?} Snape wondered, having no trouble imagining the muggle-raised Riddle using a pencil without a second thought, especially to make marks in a library book. One line led to the marriage in 1396 of Percival Pudsey to Serpentina Woolcroft. It was not the bride's name alone that caught Snape's attention, but also the tiny snake printed next to her name. Miss Woolcroft was believed to be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin.

\emph{So there really may be evidence that the Dark Lord is Slytherin's heir. I wonder how clear-cut that actually is.} An hour's study convinced Snape that it was not clear-cut at all. Slytherin's family had died out in the male line long before 1400, and the number of families descending through any one of several female lines was large. Taking into account the uncertainty of birth dates and the frequent marriage of distant cousins to combine previously separate lines, it was impossible to tell which of the many families claiming descent from Slytherin could possibly be called his 'heir.' \emph{Not that there's anything to inherit}, Snape thought. \emph{Parseltongue seems to be it. Definitely not land or money.}

Having exhausted that part of the pedigree, Snape tried another. This led, to his great surprise, to the name Peverell in Somerset around the year 1250. \emph{And here I'd given up finding any wizarding families named Peverell.}

Peverell had turned out not to be a Norman name, but a Normanization of a Welsh nickname. It was first used by the stepfather of an illegitimate son of William the Conqueror. That particular family had also died out in the male line, though later families with the same name strove to find a connection. \emph{Probably just a similar nickname, but everyone wants to have royal blood, even if out of wedlock.} None had any claim to wizarding blood, though, until now.

Following the line through names like Dionysius, Archaeleus, and Cadmus, Snape stopped in shock at Hamo. Hamo Peverell was half-brother to the son of the Conqueror, but he didn't have any children. Snape got up and searched for his notes. His memory was not at fault. The Conqueror's mistress had married Ranulph of Whittington, known as Peverell, and by him had three sons - Hamo, William, and Payne. Hamo had left his lands to his brother William, and therefore most people assumed he had no children. But what if he was a wizard? A muggle-born wizard who had to flee from his society because of his affliction? It was interesting to speculate on, but as there was still no connection between Peverell and the Founders, Snape put it aside.

Next Snape followed the little pencil marks down into 18th century charts and got another surprise. A female descendant of Percival Pudsey, one Mehitable Chaffinch, married a man named Lorenzo Gaunt of Yorkshire in 1746. There was a pencil mark by this name.

\emph{Peverell and Gaunt. Dumbledore told me to find artifacts, not ancestors of the Dark Lord. Will this be a surprise to him, or does he know this already?} Except for Serpentina Woolcroft, there was no other link to the Founders.

Snape then turned to \emph{The Tales of Beedle the Bard} and was disappointed to find it was nothing but children's stories. There were magical pots, enchanted fountains, crystal caskets... Snape didn't even read the stories, he just skimmed through them. The only interesting thing was the invisibility cloak. \emph{I bet Moody uses his to hide from Death whenever he can.} He chuckled, and tossed the book aside.

The last book was a critical analysis of the Bard's stories, and Snape was flipping idly through the pages, not really wanting to read it, when a name caught his eye. Peverell. The brothers who tried to cheat death were named Peverell. Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus Peverell, to be exact. The three names rang a bell. Snape returned to the genealogies to find they were the grandsons of Hamo Peverell, and were young men at the time of the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud.

\emph{Well, well. Gaunt, Peverell, Salazar Slytherin, and the Dark Lord, all wrapped up in Beedle the Bard. But I'll be hanged if I have a clue what it all means.}

Snape had to leave the dungeons then, and hurry upstairs, for Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts. He put the afternoon's work in another part of his brain for there were more important things to discuss.

"You are not happy, Severus. I hope your stay down south was not too unpleasant." Dumbledore sounded both official and familiar at the same time.

"I want to know why I learn more about what you're doing from the Dark Lord than from you." Snape stood by the window, staring out at the winter stars.

"Direct and to the point. What do you believe Riddle has told you about my activities?"

"You misled me about why I got the Dark Arts job. You didn't want me as the Dark Arts teacher, you wanted Slughorn on the staff. Slughorn knows something that the Dark Lord doesn't want you to know. You brought him in to keep him safe, but the only thing he can teach is Potions, so you kicked me out of the job, or halfway out of the job - I still have to do most of the administrative work. I got Dark Arts because you didn't have any place else to put me."

"True to some extent, but not true that I didn't want you for Dark Arts. You will potentially be very useful to me there."

"Potentially? I thought I was useful to you in July."

"You were. And you will be useful to me again."

"By the way, he knows something happened in July. He knows your arm was injured, he knows more or less when it happened, and he considers it significant. It seemed to be the occasion for his bringing up his displeasure at not being able to 'interview' Slughorn."

"Well, I suppose it was only a matter of time. Has he yet connected any of this with the diary that was destroyed? And why did ne want to interview Professor Slughorn?"

"I don't know. The diary was why he was so angry with the Malfoys this summer. That seems to have been much more important to him than Slughorn. The diary was his horcrux." In the ensuing silence, realization began to dawn in Snape. He turned to Dumbledore, horrified. "The ring was a horcrux, too!"

"I fear so."

"But you only make one... He can't have split... How many do you think there are?"

"I am not going to say. It is best you not know. Is Draco all right?"

Snape's gaze returned to the night sky. "He was punished, but not too badly. The Dark Lord wanted to frighten him, though, so his mother and Bella were punished more. The Dark Lord said he'd failed twice. We know about the necklace, but that means there's something else, maybe another cursed item, floating around the castle. We need to be alert."

There was the soft sound of robes sweeping the floor, then Dumbledore stood behind Snape and laid a hand gently on his shoulder. "And you? Are you all right?"

"I know what your arm felt like that night. It was my own fault; I should have told him long ago. About your arm, I mean. I forget sometimes that Hogwarts is in the same universe as headquarters, and that students can tell their parents..."

"I am deeply grateful you did not tell him. It gave me several more months in which to track down information that I might not have gotten otherwise. I grieve that you had to pay for it."

Snape ignored the apology. "I have officially been told that Malfoy has a task, but still not what it is. I'm to keep people from hindering him. I'm to tell the Dark Lord if Slughorn ever sets foot out of Hogwarts. Keep him locked up - he's a potential kidnap victim. And I'm going to report every move you make."

"I would expect no less."

"There's more." Snape paused, but Dumbledore waited quietly. "The Dark Lord accused Draco of failing - failing - twice. The Vow was not activated. Either the Dark Lord used the word without meaning absolute failure, or it isn't the Dark Lord's view of the matter that counts. I knew that Draco was still working on something just before the Christmas break, and I assume that it was the second failure, so I'd guess it's Draco's idea of what constitutes failure that counts. I intend to give him moral support and urge him to perseverance at every opportunity."

Dumbledore smiled. "I would join you, but as it appears I am to be the victim\emph{...} What of your other pursuits?"

"The Founder artifact business is entertaining. Did you know that there are three shawls of Helga Hufflepuff still in existence, but that two of them were woven from the wool of Saxon Merino sheep, a breed that didn't exist until 1765? Or that a piece supposedly of Slytherin's jewelry was offered for sale at a market in Leeds in 1762, bid on by one customer, and then bought at a lower price by another who claimed to be Slytherin's heir and terrified the owner into accommodating him by speaking Parseltongue? Or that the glove reputed to be Gryffindor's was manufactured in Newcastle in 1725? Or that Ravenclaw's measuring spoon was shown in 1833 to have been manufactured in China in 1154 BC?"

"Is there anything, Severus," Dumbledore asked, "that you have found to be true?"

Snape shrugged. "There seem to have been actual families of Gaunt and Peverell in the wizarding world. What's more, they're mentioned together in a book in the Hogwarts library. A book that someone thought interesting enough to want to mark the connection in pencil. One of the borrowers was T. Riddle, though there's no proof he was the same person who made the marks. I imagine he would have been more fascinated by the line descending from Serpentina Woolcroft."

"Let me guess," said Dumbledore with a smile. "A descendant of Slytherin's."

"Bingo," Snape replied. "But that's the only link to a Founder, and there aren't any relics or artifacts associated with her."

"I wonder," Dumbledore mused, "if he was aware of the legends surrounding the family."

"You're not talking about Mother Goose, are you?" Snape's attempt to stifle a laugh produced a sound more like a snort.

"Mother Goose?" Dumbledore eyed him quizzically. "Is that another wizarding family you have found?"

"They're children's rhymes," Snape explained. "Things babies learn at their mother's knee. Humpty Dumpty and Little Miss Muffet."

"I thought you did not know any children's stories."

"I said my parents never told me any. That doesn't mean I couldn't learn about them later. We got a few in school. And from Disney, of course."

"Of course," responded Dumbledore, for all the world as if he understood the reference. "What Mother Goose stories are we talking about?"

"Beedle the Bard. I can't believe you sent me to look up children's stories. But there is a connection to the Peverell family. It seems the characters in one story are supposed to have been three of the descendants of Hamo Peverell."

"And which story would that be?"

"You know perfectly well which story." Snape glared at the headmaster. Then his mouth twitched in a near smile. "I wonder if that's how Moody's managed to cheat Death all these years. One of his invisibility cloaks is a Hallow. Or maybe that's why the Dark Lord kidnapped Ollivander - because Ollivander's got the Elder Wand in his shop disguised as a display item."

Dumbledore's silence at this remark made Snape turn to face him, suspecting him of hiding something. "Do you think the Dark Lord knows about the Hallows? That he may have turned a thing he thought was one of them into a horcrux?"

"It is a possibility," Dumbledore said, "Though I remind you that Riddle would be much like you in that he is unlikely to have heard wizarding children's stories when he was young, and therefore may never have heard of the Hollows at all. I do like your tying them in to the kidnappings, however. That is an intriguing angle. Was there anything else that you uncovered?"

To Snape the tone sounded as if suddenly he was about to be dismissed. He still had the feeling that Dumbledore was withholding information from him. "No, sir," he replied.

"Well then, I believe we may have exhausted that line of inquiry for the moment. Keep in mind what you have learned. It may be valuable someday."

With that, the interview was over. \emph{But if what he wanted me to know was the content of a children's tale}, Snape thought on the way down to his rooms in the dungeon, \emph{why didn't he just tell me? Why make me do all that research? What might he still be hiding?}

The following Sunday evening, immediately upon arriving at Birmingham, Snape put in a request to speak to the Dark Lord. He'd no sooner gotten up to his laboratory than a messenger came with the summons, and he hurried down to the interview chamber. \emph{I don't know if this is the right thing to do or not, but I can't risk his learning about this later from someone else.}

"It is well that you have news for us," the Dark Lord told him, motioning Snape not to kneel. "We would have sent for you in any case. Tell us this news."

"Lord, it is a small matter. Dumbledore is seeking information about a wide number of ancient items, legendary artifacts. Some may never have existed outside the imagination of the story tellers, but he wishes them checked."

"Are there any in particular that he singles out for notice?"

"Yes, Lord. Items from the stories of Beedle the Bard. The tale of the three brothers. He even wishes information on the family that the brothers were said to have belonged to..."

"Yes, we know of this story. So, it is of interest to Dumbledore. He is a fool, but it is good to know in what direction his mind turns. Tell us, does Dumbledore speak of the disappearance of Ollivander?"

It was a moment pregnant with promise, that the Dark Lord should mention what Snape and Dumbledore had so recently discussed themselves. Snape's face remained bland as he answered. "He mentioned it in passing at the time. I haven't heard him talk about it since."

"Does he refer to the founders of Hogwarts, asking questions about their history?"

Snape was suddenly aware of the beating of his own heart. Pits opened on either side of him, danger and death swirled in the air around him, but now - now he had a chance to learn what the Dark Lord was thinking and planning. The dim light of the chamber glowed brighter, and every detail of the room stood out with the clarity of Venetian glass as he rolled the dice.

"Yes, Lord, he has. He's asked about possessions and artifacts of theirs as well."

"He grows troublesome. He will learn, though, that he is not as wise as he believes."

"Tell me, Lord, what must I do if he asks again?"

"He must not suspect you. You will assist him to the best of your ability. If you should discover what he seeks, or if he should tell you what he has found, you will report it to us instantly."

"And if he doesn't share it with me?"

"Then he does not share it. It will make little difference in the end."

Snape once again paced the breadth of the carpet in Dumbledore's office, a caged beast whose movements were those of frustration rather than strength. "You don't understand, sir. He already knew you were looking for these things. He could be planning some kind of a trap!"

"Well," said Dumbledore complacently, "this may complicate things a bit. I shall definitely have to proceed with more caution. Meanwhile, you will do as both your masters command and find out as much as you can about the..."

"No. Sir."

"I beg your pardon?"

"I will not help you in this. You'd actually walk right into whatever he's planning for you and get yourself killed. I won't be party to this. I won't do any more research for you."

"And here I thought that having Tom and I in agreement about your job would make things easier for you. You can please both of us without subterfuge."

"No. I will not help you kill yourself."

Dumbledore watched Snape for a moment, his expression hardening. "You have a very poor opinion of my abilities if you think that Riddle can take me so easily after I've been forewarned. I assure you that I am not going to walk right into anything without employing proper precautions. Now, you have been working on tracing all the reputed artifacts..."

"No. I won't do it."

"Severus, I have not known you to refuse to follow my instructions before. This is becoming tedious."

"No, sir. It's becoming dangerous. I'm not going to lose you. What'll you do? Send me to Azkaban?"

"Professor Snape, you will continue to assist me in the research I have requested from you."

"It isn't in my job description. You can't make me."

"I can dismiss you from the school."

"I think I could explain that to the Dark Lord's satisfaction."

It was a stalemate. Dumbledore turned away, his anger seeming to simmer just under the surface. "You have a class in ten minutes, Professor. I suggest you not be derelict in that duty as well."

Snape left the office without another word, his own anger at Dumbledore's stubbornness just beginning to seethe like a poison brewing in his veins.

Thursday evening after supper, Dumbledore paused on his way out of the Great Hall and turned to face the staff table. The message was clear, delivered and received in a fraction of a second. \emph{I would appreciate it if you would come to my office this evening. Say, around eight?}

The atmosphere in the room was much more relaxed than it had been when Snape last left, and Dumbledore handed him a goblet of mead as he entered, raising his own glass and smiling slightly as he proposed, "Confusion to the enemy."

"That I can drink to," replied Snape, joining him. He then waited for Dumbledore to begin.

"Yes," said Dumbledore after a moment. "We ended our last meeting on such a sour note that I thought we might discuss those points on which we are in agreement. Shall we sit down?" He moved two chairs in front of the fire and Snape, seeing no reason not to, settled into one of them. The warmth was welcome on a cold January night.

"Now," Dumbledore continued, "I should like to be sure that we are acting in unison with regard to Draco. Draco must be protected."

"I'm pleased to see you're still concerned about the boy."

"Severus, I am concerned about all my students. With some, I confess, it is easier than with others. Goyle, for example. The way he stands with his hands hanging down and his mouth slightly open... Not funny? No, I imagine not. I have never been good with spontaneous humor. But Draco, now. Draco is rather easy to feel concerned about."

"I am... both pleased and surprised to hear you say so."

"Surprised? How so?"

"There has from the beginning been something of an antagonism between him and... Potter."

"Oh, and you suspected that I would see things more from Harry's point of view. Has it really seemed to you that I have played favorites?"

"There are times when it has been blatant. I still haven't forgiven you about the House Cup at the end of their first year."

Dumbledore frowned, then let it pass. "Draco is bright, ambitious, loyal, hardworking, suffers from an overbearing father, and would be a sweet boy if given half a chance. He craves affection, but has had to live his schooldays under the shadow of the popularity of Harry. He does somewhat remind me of you."

"I think that's stretching it a little, sir."

"Really? Well, I try. In any case, Draco deserves a future, and I do not wish to see his chances destroyed by having his soul split due to a murder."

"There, sir, we are in agreement."

"I am glad. You will see, therefore, why it is necessary, should it come to it, that you take Draco's task from him and accomplish it yourself."

"Why don't we just take the opportunity away from Draco and leave the task incomplete?"

"You seem not to comprehend, Severus. I am concerned about all my students, past as well as present. There is the matter of the Vow."

"No, sir. I don't think you're really thinking about me. You're thinking of sacrificing yourself so that I can stay alive, but that's not thinking about me, it's thinking about yourself."

"Well I am flummoxed! How can that be thinking about myself?"

"You don't want to have to live with the guilt of my death."

"I would not be guilty. I did not make an Unbreakable Vow."

"No, I did. And I'm the one who has to accept the consequences of that action. We have to protect Draco, on that we agree. And you have to stay alive to fight the Dark Lord. We're in this quandary because of something I did, ergo I should face the consequences."

"Severus, I am an old man. You are young and still have..."

"Why are you worried about Draco splitting his soul, but you're not worried about me splitting mine?"

The silence lengthened in the tower office as Dumbledore and Snape stared at each other in the glow of the fire. At last Dumbledore rose and refilled the goblets of mead.

"You have never killed anyone?" Dumbledore stood now by the mantle, staring into the fire.

"If I had, I would have told you. Surely you knew that?"

"You told me so much. I did not want to pry further. You'd been a Death Eater for some years..."

"The Dark Lord has always preferred specialists. I was recruited for potions and spells. And later for defense training. I wasn't allowed on field assignments because... Do you remember my grandmother?"

"Constantina Rossendale was a grand lady. Such a tragic death. Yes, you told me about that."

"So... I wasn't allowed on field assignments."

"You present me with a great problem."

"I don't think so. We let events unfold. We try to protect Malfoy. I don't kill you, and whatever happens, happens."

"It is not a satisfactory solution."

"It is to me." Snape stared into his again empty goblet, then rose and refilled it himself. He was beginning to feel rather mellow. "Besides, you haven't considered what my life would be like if I did what you wanted."

"You would have a life."

"That's a matter of opinion. Let's assume first that no one knew it was me that killed you. Without you to spy on, I would have no excuse to give the Dark Lord for remaining at Hogwarts. Potter would poison the rest of the Order against me, and I'd be forced to stay at headquarters doing the Dark Lord's bidding with no one on the outside to turn to. I see suicide as a viable alternative, which would make your sacrifice meaningless.

"On the other hand, if it were known that I killed you it would be worse. Everyone outside the Death Eater organization would be after me. Can you see me trying to explain to Potter and Moody that I did it on your orders? Give me a break. Once again, suicide becomes a highly attractive alternative. Do you really want that?"

"I do not want you dead. Not under any circumstances, and certainly not because of a Vow."

"Are you certain of how the Vow will operate?"

"No. Especially since you took the Vow unaware of its terms. Vows are tricky. I cannot predict how this one will operate."

"All the more reason not to jump the gun. I may not have to do anything. And the worst scenario in that case is still better than the best scenario if we follow your plan."

Dumbledore agreed not to press the issue, and Snape returned to his duties somewhat lighter of heart. He did no more research for Dumbledore, but supplied the Dark Lord with most of the details of what he'd already done. The Dark Lord listened to the litany of artifacts, confirmed or spurious, of shawls and rings, of capes and gloves, with calm detachment. "Is there nothing more?" he asked at the end.

"Some rumored to have once existed, but now lost forever," Snape replied, and gave the Dark Lord that list as well, at the end of which the Dark Lord seemed pleased. Snape was dismissed to continue with his regular assignments is the lab, where Yaxley now assisted him on a regular basis.

Gradually, Snape was beginning to realize what an excellent partner Yaxley was. Neither of the two was overly ambitious, and neither was fanatical about being a Death Eater. There was no conspiracy, just a tacit mutual agreement not to discuss certain things. Above all there was a common sense that they would watch each other's back up to a point, and the point was understood. It was a comfortable relationship, insofar as anything at headquarters could be said to be comfortable.

At Hogwarts, life continued normally, though Malfoy persisted in withholding details of what he was doing from Snape. Things were, in fact, so distressingly normal, that the upcoming annual apparition lessons on the first of February were something to look forward to.

Rain fell sadly from the gray sky that Saturday, turning the lawn into mud and dissolving the last of the snow. Snape and McGonagall stood at her first floor window staring out at the dreary weather.

"Well, it won't be the first time we had apparition lessons in the Great Hall." McGonagall sighed.

"In some ways it's more fun in the Hall, where they all have to be crowded together more. It concentrates the action. Not that there'll be much on the first day."

"You sound like you're going to the circus!"

"In a way I am," replied Snape, keeping a perfectly straight face. "You have no idea who I'm hoping is going to splinch today, or how."

"You wicked man! Are you actually planning to gloat over Gryffindor's gaffes?"

"Did you do that on purpose, or was it serendipitous?"

"What are you talking about, dear lad?"

"Let's see... I may not gloat over Gryffindor's gaffes, but I may rejoice over Ravenclaw's ruptures."

Through her laughter, McGonagall managed, "Savor Slytherin's splinching! Now let's see you do H!"

The letter H proved more difficult, and they made their way downstairs tossing possibilities back and forth.

"Honor..."

"Too respectful. Hilariate."

"There's no such word as hilariate!"

"Aha! Howl over Hufflepuff's haplessness!"

The sixth years were milling around in the Great Hall, unsure what to do, as the four Heads of Houses entered behind Wilkie Twycross. Just as they were passing through the door, Snape whispered to McGonagall, "Stephen Cornfoot's ears," with the result that she looked particularly cross and out-of-sorts as she struggled desperately to stifle her giggles.

As Twycross began to introduce himself, McGonagall found focus in the disciplining of two students who were softly conferring in the back of the crowd, the only two whose eyes were not on the apparition instructor. "Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!"

Snape's glance went at once to the movement as Malfoy and Crabbe separated. Two Death Eater children with fathers in Azkaban. \emph{Have you been foolish enough to share your mission with Crabbe, or does fear of the Dark Lord keep you secretive?} It was a momentary thought, as the apparition lessons began in earnest.

Snape, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout began to separate and line up their students by houses, with Snape between McGonagall and Flitwick. There was a moment when Potter and Malfoy started posturing like rival peacocks, but the professors quickly got them into line.

Destination! Determination! Deliberation! - every year the professors heard the same speech. Every year the beginning students twirled stupidly in their efforts to apparate the few inches to the hoops set before them. Watching the irritating, lazy students he struggled hardest to teach stagger dizzily around the Hall was one of the high points of Snape's year. Externally he was stern and unmoved. Internally he was laughing.

"What was your worst splinch?" McGonagall asked as it became increasingly clear that there were no apparating geniuses in the crowd.

"I never splinched," Snape replied.

"Never? That's hard to believe."

"My mother taught me to apparate when I was nine. I spent my first couple of lessons here pretending I didn't know what to do so that no one would find out."

"But that's illeg..." McGonagall started to protest, but at that moment Susan Bones splinched. It was a bad splinch - her entire left leg - and the girl was going into shock. Snape, McGonagall, and Flitwick all rushed to assist Sprout in reuniting the girl and getting her up to Madam Pomfrey. Splinching like that was rare, but needed to be addressed immediately or the emotional trauma could keep a person from ever trying to apparate again.

In the excitement, Snape's and McGonagall's conversation was forgotten, and the lesson soon ended.
