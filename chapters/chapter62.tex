\subsection{Chapter 62: Chapter 62 â€“ The Conspiracy of the Sword}

\textbf{What of My Soul, Dumbledore?: The Conspiracy of the Sword}

Shifting the topic from himself to more tactical matters helped Snape focus through his stress and exhaustion, and he stirred with more interest now. "Yes, and we've been watching it. There are people out there every day, but so far Potter's been careful and they've seen nothing. It's because he set off the Taboo."

"What Taboo would that be?" Dumbledore asked.

"The Ministry's put a Taboo on saying the Dark Lord's name. It was picked up the first night. Quite ingenious, really. I couldn't imagine Potter going for any time at all without using the name in conversation with his friends."

"It is indeed ingenious. I, however, have even more information about what is going on inside. Phineas? Phineas!" The portrait of Phineas Nigellus did not stir. Dumbledore looked over his spectacles at Snape. "He is taking advantage of the fact that he can ignore me now that we have a headmaster. Do you think you might wake him, Severus?"

"Eh, certainly. Excuse me, Headmaster Nigellus. Could we... could I have a word with you?"

Nigellus shifted and blinked his eyes. "What a polite young man!" he exclaimed. "Why weren't you ever that polite to me, Albus?"

"I suppose because we were both of an age to call each other Phineas and Albus. Severus here is only thirty-seven. Why, you must be the youngest headmaster in... in... Phineas, was there ever a younger headmaster?"

Nigellus chose to ignore the question since Snape did not ask it. "What did you wish to ask me, young man?"

"You've been in contact with the Black residence, haven't you? What's Harry Potter doing?"

Puffing out his chest with importance, Nigellus said, "They chased the werewolf away, and they are trying to get into the Ministry of Magic. They are not having great success."

"The Ministry of Magic!" Snape exclaimed. "Are they crazy? And what werewolf? Greyback?"

"Well now," Nigellus admitted, "I don't hear everything. I'm in the one bedroom, and I do visit the other portraits in different parts of the house from time to time, but they spend a lot of time in the kitchen with the house-elf - more like servants themselves, really - so I don't get everything. They were talking about a locket in Regulus's bedroom the day after they got there, but then they went downstairs and to the kitchen. The werewolf came on the fifth. They talked in the kitchen, then there was a bang, and the werewolf stalked out. He was angry about something. Yes, and the house-elf was gone for three days, and after he came back they started trying to find a way into the Ministry. The house-elf has gone crazy, by the way. He's cleaning everything, and he's changed into a new towel."

Dumbledore chuckled. "That sounds like a happy house-elf. Harry and Kreacher, together at last. I wonder what happened. It also sounds more like the werewolf was Remus Lupin."

"Well, at least it's something," said Snape. To Nigellus he said, "Please keep me posted if anything happens. It could be important."

Nigellus agreed and immediately left for his portrait in Grimmauld Place.

"A lot is going to change," Snape said to Dumbledore after a moment. "The new laws..."

"Yes, Minerva has told me. She has been quite incensed about it. What will the Ministry do with Hogwarts now?"

"Dolores Umbridge has already started. She wants me to sack people, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Hagrid for example. I threw the charter in her face and hid behind the Board of Governors. Oh, and we have two Death Eaters on staff. Amycus and Alecto Carrow. Amycus is Dark Arts, and Alecto is Muggle Studies. The Dark Lord warned them to start out smoothly and not cause trouble, at least at first. He's been preoccupied with something, and I had the feeling he was hinting that he was going somewhere and didn't want his plans disturbed by petty problems."

"Hmm," said Dumbledore. "Now where would Riddle go?"

They talked for a couple of hours more, and then Snape made his way downstairs to the Great Hall for dinner. He felt exhausted, physically, mentally, and emotionally. This meeting was going to be a short one.

In the Great Hall, no one had taken a seat. Snape immediately decided to follow Dumbledore's old custom of not sitting at the high table when school was out of session. Instead they sat around a table in the middle of the Hall McGonagall at Snape's right, and the Carrows on his left - where he could control them better.

Food came first; the meeting was after dinner. The staff was reserved and quiet until Alecto tried to say something about the new laws. Snape stopped her. "We do not discuss business during a meal," he said. "That's for later." That broke the ice a little and the teachers chatted with each other about other things.

"You have a strange way of taking charge," Alecto said to Snape in a low voice.

"You need to learn to adapt to different situations," Snape replied, noting that McGonagall had not missed the exchange.

Dinner over, McGonagall, as Deputy Headmistress, called the meeting to order with a tap of her spoon against her glass. Everyone was silent at once. She looked at Snape. "Headmaster?" she said.

Snape was immensely grateful to his old colleague for treating this whole situation as if it were even marginally normal. The last time he'd seen Flitwick, he'd stunned him. McGonagall had watched him flee the school in the company of Draco Malfoy and a party of Death Eaters. Every one of them had heard Potter's story of how he'd murdered Albus Dumbledore. McGonagall did have the word of Dumbledore's portrait that he, Snape, was on the side of the angels, but there was also so much for her to be angry at.

"First, I have introduced them already, but I should like again to present the newest members of our staff. Amycus Carrow has a very well-grounded practical experience in the Dark Arts, and will be able to impart that experience with considerable success to our students. Alecto has been specifically suggested as someone particularly suited to implementing the new Muggle Studies curriculum created by the Ministry of Magic and approved by the Board of Governors. They both come recommended at the highest level, and I know everyone here will do everything possible to make them feel welcome at Hogwarts." Snape started the polite little round of applause, and the others joined him - politely. Amycus and Alecto looked astounded. It was a milieu outside their experience.

\emph{And of course, neither of you has the slightest clue that I just warned the whole staff that Amycus is an active Death Eater who is going to try to recruit the students, or that Alecto is a muggle-hater. And that you are both here because the Dark Lord wants you here.}

"I wish," Snape continued, "that I could have been here earlier. Arriving the day before the students hardly gives us any time, but I am confident that you do not need my supervision to accomplish the routine business of preparing for the coming year. Everything tomorrow will be run according to long-standing tradition."

The teachers nodded, for now Snape had told them he would not be watching them every minute, and he did not come to make drastic changes.

"One thing that will make a dramatic difference is the change in the student body. All of our former muggle-born students will no longer attend Hogwarts. This is in compliance with the new laws regarding the restriction of magic. In their place we will receive all the pureblood, half-blood, and part-blood students who previously were home schooled or attended other schools. In fact, it is apparent that the size of the school will increase dramatically from its previous number of two hundred eighty students to four hundred - Professor McGonagall, do you have an exact number?"

"Four hundred thirty-nine," stated McGonagall crisply. The teachers shifted and looked at each other in dismay.

"All of these new students, regardless of age and year, will have to be sorted. Heads of houses, have you prepared extension spells for the dormitories and common rooms? The bathrooms and lavatories?" They nodded. Snape did not probe or question, assuming they told the truth.

"The bad news is that staffing will not increase. I have discussed it with the Board of Governors and they have decided that, despite the Ministry's desire to supplement staffing, it would be less disruptive if the changes were implemented by a staff that is experienced and used to working together." And the translation of this was that no Ministry watchdogs would be spying on the staff. They had to deal with the Carrows, but not with anyone else.

"Your class sizes and your workload will increase. Extracurricular supervisory duties will increase. I apologize, but it can't be helped. I guess that's all I have to say. A lot of the future is a question mark. Some of that will be resolved tomorrow when we see who the train brings us. Any questions?"

Slughorn raised a hand. It was strange for Snape to have his old Potions teacher deferring to him. It was strange to have any of them deferring to him, but especially Slughorn, Flitwick, and McGonagall, who had watched him being sorted when he was eleven years old. It was like supervising your parents.

"Headmaster," said Slughorn, "I don't have any of my supplies. We submitted the orders at the beginning of August, but nothing's here yet."

Snape turned to McGonagall. "We sent them in as usual," she said, "and the orders came back with instructions to resubmit them on Ministry requisition forms. They want to examine everything we order. I've tried to get them to hurry. No one listens to me."

"I'll contact the Ministry myself, first thing in the morning. Have contingency plans ready, though. It's Potions that's affected the most. Can you give me a list of the ten things that have highest priority? I can make a special plea for those." Snape looked around. There were no other questions.

"Good. Tomorrow is our last chance to relax until the Christmas break. Make the most of it. Be at your stations by six-thirty. When the Express hits Hogsmeade, fun and games are over."

As they walked together to the marble staircase, McGonagall said, "Nicely done. You can be almost personable when you try. How long d'ye think the honeymoon will last?"

"I honestly don't know," said Snape. "With all the new laws and the Ministry breathing down my neck. If I make it through the school year at all, I'll be extremely grateful."

\emph{Monday, September 1, 1997}

Breakfast was served late the following morning to allow the staff one more chance to sleep in before the Christmas break. Snape was up earlier, talking by Floo network with the supply liaison at the Ministry, trying to get Slughorn's Potions ingredients. He was bounced from clerk to clerk for nearly an hour before he finally got someone who promised to get back to him with a report. It was the best that could be done for the moment.

Snape did have the feeling that those he spoke to were treating him with... not respect, exactly, but a certain respectful fear, as if they knew by whose order he was at Hogwarts and passed him from colleague to colleague more because none of them wanted to be the one responsible for telling him 'no' than for any other reason.

\emph{Great! Now it's common knowledge that I'm a Death Eater and work for the Dark Lord. If Potter ever manages to defeat the Dark Lord, I'd better be as close to Dumbledore's portrait as I can get, or I'm going to be lynched.}

Most of the staff had started breakfast by the time Snape came down. They were scattered in small groups around the Hall rather than at one table, but that was normal. Snape took a seat at what was usually the Slytherin table and helped himself to toast, kipper, and coffee.

Alecto slid onto the bench next to Snape, her brother beside her. "When are you going to whip these muggle-lovers into line, Snape? You're supposed to be in charge here."

Snape looked around the Hall. "Everyone seems to be doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. I'd say they were in line and I am in charge. Would you kindly tell me who has been talking to you about loving muggles?"

"They taught muggle-borns!" Alecto spat out. "They're contaminated!"

"I shall inform the Dark Lord you question his decision. I'm sure he'll be pleased to have your opinion on the subject."

Alecto drew back, her eyes wide. Amycus leaned forward. "She's not questioning anything, Snape. Why'd you say a thing like that?"

Snape turned to face both of them. "This is an unfamiliar world to you, and you'd better learn the rules. If you want to undermine the Dark Lord's plans, just keep on doing what you're doing." He could see that most of the teachers in the Hall were now surreptitiously watching the three of them, but they were isolated enough on the Slytherin side of the Hall that no one would be able to hear.

"First," Snape continued, "I am Headmaster of Hogwarts. You will call me Headmaster, or sir, at all times. The Dark Lord has placed me in charge. If you don't treat me with respect, the others will doubt my authority, and he will not be pleased with you. Second, up until two months ago, I taught muggle-borns. Am I contaminated? He clearly considers me the best choice for the job or he would have picked someone else. Do you want to tell the Dark Lord he made a mistake?"

Both Alecto and Amycus now looked slightly cowed.

"We've been here less than twenty-four hours," went on Snape. "You know nothing of the school. Didn't Bella teach you anything? You have to lay the groundwork for a successful operation. The first step is to establish your own credentials. You will call everyone here Professor, or Madam, and by four o'clock I want to know what you intend to do in every class you have scheduled for the rest of the week. I want to know that you actually opened and looked at the texts you're supposed to be teaching from."

"Excuse me, Headmaster." McGonagall had approached them quietly, unnoticed, from behind Alecto and Amycus. "If it's convenient for you, I am prepared to go over the lists of the incoming students and brief you on all the preparations that have been made. Perhaps after breakfast?"

"I think I'm finished here, Professor McGonagall. If you like, I can come now." Snape nodded to the Carrows. "Professor. Professor. Thank you for your company." He rose and left the Hall with McGonagall, heading up to her office on the first floor.

During the inspection of the students' files, McGonagall's behavior was professional but cool. \emph{How much of that conversation did she overhear, I wonder,} Snape thought, \emph{and did it make her trust me less rather than more?}

There were so many students who could not return. Just among the seventh years there were Hermione Granger (of course), Hannah Abbot, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Sally Anne Perks, Terry Boot, Kevin Entwhistle, Lisa Turpin... Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were the hardest hit. Interesting, too, that most of the newcomers were purebloods or half-bloods with old wizarding names. The thought crossed his mind that their families had kept them out of Hogwarts for the same blood purity reasons that inspired Umbridge and the Dark Lord. The school was turning into quite a little hothouse of the wizarding elite. \emph{Who'll they go after next? Half-bloods like me? Hagrid and I are the only half-bloods on the staff.}

Snape spent the afternoon arguing with the Ministry, reviewing the events of July and August with Dumbledore, and revising the Carrows' lesson plans. At six-thirty he went down to join the others in the final preparations for the arrival of the Hogwarts Express.

The welcoming feast was a nightmare. To begin with, for the first time in its hundred year history, the Hogwarts Express left King's Cross station nearly an hour late. The arrival of so many students, almost fifty percent of whom had never been in a muggle train station before, or through the barrier to Platform 9 3/4, or on a train, had resulted in complete chaos and the need for the Ministry to alter the memories of one hundred seventeen muggles.

Next, all of these new students had to cross the lake on boats to be given the Secret, for while Hogwarts was not exactly protected by a Fidelius Charm, its defenses were similar. The boats had to make the trip five times.

Needless to say, the Sorting also took nearly five times as long, though Snape was beginning to get the feeling that the Sorting Hat toward the end started calling out "Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin... just to get the whole business over with. Slytherin house ended up twice as big as any of the others, and they had to magic in another table to go across the rear of the hall. Slughorn was having fits trying to make his extending spells more powerful, and the house-elves insisted that they really had run out of treacle tart, and please give them more advance warning in the future.

Snape kept his welcoming speech to the bare minimum. Most of the students already knew of his appointment since it had been in that morning's \emph{Daily Prophet.} There were cheers from Slytherin, boos from Gryffindor, and polite neutrality from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Snape ignored them all, introduced the Carrows, set out the most basic of the rules, and dismissed everyone to their houses. It was ten minutes before midnight.

Up in his office, the portrait of Dumbledore was considerate enough to allow Snape to pour himself a goblet of mead and sit comfortably before his fire for a grand total of fifty-seven seconds before announcing, "Phineas has been sacked, you know. Bagged. Pouched."

"Poached?" said Snape.

"No. Pouched. Locked in a lady's reticule."

"The mudblood," broke in Nigellus, "has placed me in her purse."

"Don't say mudblood," warned Dumbledore.

"You no longer give me orders," Nigellus replied.

"Don't say mudblood, please," said Snape. "I presume you're speaking of the Granger girl and your portrait in Grimmauld Place. However could she put a portrait into a handbag?"

"She has Extended it. It is horrible what that poor picture is forced to cohabit with - books, clothing, food - I shudder at the thought of returning."

"Wait a minute. This doesn't make sense. Why would she put your picture into her handbag?"

"She thinks she is being clever," Nigellus sniffed. "They read in the \emph{Prophet} that you'd been named Headmaster, and they want to prevent my overhearing them and reporting back to you."

"Did it work?" Snape asked.

"After a fashion. I cannot see them, but I can hear them every time she opens the bag. When she put me in, she tossed the bag aside without latching it properly. I have actually learned more in the past couple of hours than in all of last month because I am now with them in the kitchen."

There was a long pause. "And..." Snape prompted at last.

Nigellus sniffed again. "You wish me to tell you?"

"Of course," said Snape. "Do go on."

"They have been observing the entrance to the Ministry for the past month, collecting information so that when they go inside, they won't be detected. They plan to use Polyjuice Potion. They are after the Umbridge woman, or rather they are after something she possesses. They plan to go tomorrow. There is something wrong with the Potter boy, who left at one point. The others followed him and they were away from the kitchen for a while. It had something to do with the scar he bears."

Snape looked at the portrait of Dumbledore. "What can we do?" he asked.

"Nothing," said Dumbledore. "Nigellus cannot warn them; they would assume he came from you. Neither you nor I can warn them. Naturally we cannot warn the Ministry, nor do we have any means to warn the Order that would not be counterproductive. We must wait and see what happens. Phineas, yesterday you said they spoke of a locket in Regulus's bedroom. I know of a locket, but Harry already has it. What were they talking about?"

Nigellus thought for a moment. "It made very little sense. There was something about a basin in a cave, and the initials R.A.B. - which was my young kinsman Regulus - and finding a locket that could not be opened, but they threw it away - Oh, but they think that what the Umbridge woman has cannot be opened either! Maybe they think it is the locket they are seeking."

"It cannot be," Dumbledore repeated. "Harry already has that locket."

They were silent. Then Dumbledore turned to Snape. "R.A.B.," he said softly. "Severus, how did Regulus Black die?"

Snape was surprised by the question. "We didn't know. One day he was there, and then he was gone. The Dark Lord summoned him, and there was no response. We always assumed he'd been caught and killed by... by the Order. To be honest, it was one of the reasons I accepted the story that Sirius had betrayed Lily and James - because he went over to the Dark Lord's side after the Order killed his brother."

"No, Sirius always thought Riddle had Regulus killed. Strange. And they know of Regulus because of R.A.B., which has something to do with the locket."

"Albus," Nigellus said, "the house-elf started wearing a locket right after the Potter boy arrived."

"Really!" exclaimed Dumbledore. "What did it look like?"

"Gold. Not very valuable. Rather plain... I think it was in the house long ago..."

"I am a fool," said Dumbledore. "Of course, that is understandable, since I had just drunk a basin full of poison. It was not the same locket. Regulus must have somehow switched them and then disappeared. The real one was at Grimmauld Place all these years. How on earth might Umbridge have gotten it?"

"Mundungus Fletcher," said Snape with a sigh. "He robbed the house after Sirius died, remember? When he sold that Death Eater a box with a Black emblem and Bella nearly strung the poor man up by his thumbs?"

"Ah, yes." Dumbledore paused. "You know, this means that we want Harry to get into the Ministry and take the locket back. It will be an excellent thing if he achieves it."

"Headmaster Nigellus," Snape asked the portrait. "Would you continue to find out as much as you can about what Potter and his friends are doing? I know it might conflict with your own sentiments..."

"Conflict with my own sentiments!" Nigellus exclaimed. "I know you cannot possibly understand all of this, young man, because you are yourself a poor, benighted half-blood - though from what I hear, of respectable provincial wizarding stock - but the wizarding world is falling into the hands of an upstart half-blood madman spawned in the despicable, ignorant, lunatic house of Gaunt - a blight on us all, that the blood of Salazar Slytherin should have sunk so low - and I for one consider it my duty to help expunge him from the pages of history."

Snape froze in shock, but Dumbledore chuckled. "Phineas can talk like that," he said, "because he has been dead for more than seventy years. It is easy to be brave when one cannot be harmed."

"Humph!" said Nigellus, and left his portrait to stand watch in Grimmauld Place.

Thus it was that the following morning, as staff and students breakfasted and then made their way to the first classes of the school year, the little group of headmasters in the tower office followed the exploits of the Potter gang.

"They have the Polyjuice Potion and the Invisibility Cloak," Nigellus reported, "but what in the name of Merlin are Decoy Detonators, Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, and Extendable Ears?"

Dumbledore laughed heartily, and even Snape smiled. "Fred and George Weasley," Snape said, though that was hardly an explanation.

Dumbledore sobered. "That was unfortunate about George Weasley," he said, "though I know that you did not mean to do it."

Snape was horrified. "What did I do to George Weasley?" he demanded.

"Oh, my. I thought you knew. He was one of the many Potters. It seems you cut his ear off."

"Great," said Snape. "Something else to add to my load of crimes. How long and how heavy will the chains be before you're done?"

"I beg your pardon, Severus."

"Jacob Marley," said Snape, and declined to explain further.

Nigellus told them when Granger, looking now like another witch, fed Puking Pastilles to a small wizard, and when Granger gave larger robes to Potter so that he could transform with his Polyjuice Potion, too. And even the enchanted bag could not entirely mask the sound of toilets flushing as Granger entered the Ministry.

"You should know," said Dumbledore, "that Headmistress Dilys Derwent has a portrait in the Ministry of Magic, as does Everard over there."

At Snape's request, both hurried to the Ministry to see if they could discover what was happening to Harry Potter.

Derwent was back in a few minutes. "Everard is keeping an eye out, but we really don't know who to watch. They're Polyjuiced, and we don't know who they've Polyjuiced into. It could be anyone. Everard is going to visit Faris Spavin. He has a portrait in the waiting room outside Umbridge's office as well as the Minister's antechamber. Maybe Everard can see them go into her office."

They waited. It seemed an eternity, but was really only about half an hour. Then Everard returned, rather precipitously. "Explosions!" he yelled as he raced into his frame. "Oh my goodness! I saw the Invisibility Cloak! Or rather I didn't see it! You know what I mean! He stole her peephole!"

"Who was he, Everard?" Derwent asked.

"Don't know. He took off the cloak while he searched the office. Tall, very tall, strong, bearded..." He described the Ministry official whose form concealed what they all knew was Harry Potter. The two returned to the Ministry.

"Well," said Snape. "I confess to being impressed. He got to her office. That is something."

"I wonder," mused Dumbledore, "what Everard meant by 'stealing her peephole.' It is an odd expression."

Snape looked up, fighting to keep his emotions down. Dumbledore saw this and held up a hand. "There is grief here, Severus, is there not? Do not hide it from me. Do not hide it from yourself. In this office, you are lord. Everything is allowed."

Turning to the window to look down on the lake for a moment, Snape let his mind fill with the memory of Alastor Moody. After several minutes he was able to control his voice, and not because he had locked the moment away. He held Moody in front of his mental vision.

"After Moody... died... the Dark Lord took his enchanted eye from its socket. I learned later that he'd given it to Umbridge in reward for her zeal, and she used it to spy on her secretary."

"And Harry has taken it back. That was well done."

There were a few more minutes of waiting, and then the fat hit the fire, the two spying wizards bouncing in and out of their portraits to report.

"Something's happening in the criminal court area!"

"There's an order to lock down the main entrance!"

"Fight in the Atrium! Fight in the Atrium!"

Derwent brought the last report. "Albert Runcorn just helped nearly a dozen accused muggle-borns escape from the Ministry through the Atrium itself!"

"Excellent!" cried Dumbledore. "Were there any other odd pureblood wizards with him?"

"Mafalda Hopkirk and Reg Cattermole."

"There you are, Severus! They got in, and they have escaped! Well done, Harry! Well done!"

Dumbledore's joy was interrupted by the sudden reappearance of Phineas Nigellus, who was breathing hard. "Don't ever... Don't ever ask me..." he gasped. "Albus, it was never this chaotic while you were headmaster. This boy has got to go."

"This boy, Phineas, is living in dangerous times. Do not blame him for the times. It is not Severus's fault."

Nigellus didn't reply for a moment. When he'd recovered somewhat, he told them, "They've left the Black home. They're on the run."

"How?" Snape exclaimed. "How do you know?"

"We apparated, and then suddenly, practically in the middle of the apparation, the mud... the Granger girl switched direction. Then, a few minutes after we stopped, someone opened her bag and summoned Essence of Dittany."

Snape paled. "Essence of Dittany is to stop copious bleeding and mend torn tissue," he said. "Someone's been injured."

"Where are they?" Dumbledore asked Nigellus.

Forgetting that he was not obeying Dumbledore anymore, Phineas Nigellus looked around at the attentive portraits and the Headmaster. "I do not know," he said. "Some place quiet. Very quiet. Like a forest or a moor. No people at all."

They all were silent, and then Snape looked at an antique clock on the mantelpiece. "It's lunchtime," he said wearily. "I'm supposed to go down and find out how the morning classes went." He rose and, bracing himself for the transition between the world of his office and the world of the school, he crossed to the door and left.

On his way down, Snape pondered the strange alteration in his existence. Dumbledore had always, almost always, kept him in the dark about his plans. Now he, Snape, had access to information beyond his wildest dreams. No wonder Dumbledore had spent so much time secluded in his office, leaving the running of the school to McGonagall! The secrets of Ministry and home were open to him as long as someone there had a portrait of a former headmaster. How many wizards today guarded a secret portrait of Dumbledore hidden behind...

Snape stopped. It could not be. It was impossible. He turned and sprinted back up the stairs and into the office, quivering with the idea. The portrait of Dumbledore was so surprised that he didn't even pretend to be sleeping.

"Where can you go?" Snape demanded.

"I do not know, Severus. I have never been a dead portrait before, and no one has yet asked me to try going anywhere. Is there somewhere you want me to go?"

"Not yet," said Snape, "but does it work with chocolate frog cards?"

"I do not know." Dumbledore looked around. "Very few headmasters ever made it onto a card, maybe none, in fact. Armando! Armando you are on a Famous Wizard Card, are you not? Can you visit your cards?"

Headmaster Dippet yawned and stretched. "Of course I can," he said grumpily. "How do you think I keep up with the antics of my great-grandchildren?"

"Well, there you have it, Severus. I suppose I can."

"What a minute!" Nigellus was awake and alert. "Why am I not on one of these cards! I'm famous!"

Dumbledore glanced at Snape. "I think I shall let you answer that one," he said.

"It's very simple, Headmaster Nigellus," Snape replied, glaring at Dumbledore. "The cards aren't really a catalog of fame or importance. They're for children. Half of them are popular singers and Quidditch players. The only reason Professor Dumbledore is on one is because the children know him personally from school."

Nigellus seemed mollified. "Thank you, Severus," said Dumbledore, but his heart was clearly not in it.

Snape went back downstairs and into the Great Hall. The teachers were there, arrayed down the high table as they had been at the feast the night before, as they would be every day until Christmas. Flanking the center chair were McGonagall on the right and Alecto Carrow on the left. Snape approached the table. This had to be handled carefully. At any moment the Carrows could become dangerous if the Dark Lord's mood swung their way.

"Ah, Professor Carrow," he said, pointedly ignoring McGonagall. "May I speak with you for a moment? I have need of your advice." He circled the table and led her into the little room off the dais.

"What do you want, Snape?" Alecto asked as the door closed behind them. Snape drew himself up and simply looked at her, unwavering, until she dropped her gaze. "How can I help you, Headmaster," Alecto said, a note of resentment in her voice.

"You and Amycus are unfamiliar with custom here. You should probably ask if you're uncertain about something. We're supposed to be trying to win support for the Dark Lord, not alienate people. I know you didn't mean to..."

"What did I do now?"

"The seat to the left of the Headmaster is reserved for the senior Head of house. That's Professor Flitwick. Flitwick taught Charms when the Dark Lord was at Hogwarts, and may have influence..."

"The Dark Lord went here?"

\emph{Of course}, Snape reminded himself. \emph{Very few of the lower level Death Eaters know anything of the Dark Lord's past. Mulciber and Avery know - their fathers were at Hogwarts with him. But not Macnair, or the Carrows...}

"This is what I mean, Professor Carrow. Until you learn the lay of the land, there are pitfalls you can only avoid by being cautious. I, for one, would hesitate to show disrespect to Professor Flitwick without knowing the Dark Lord's will in the matter."

Alecto left first. Without drawing attention to herself, she joined her brother further down the table. Only then did Snape leave the room and take his place in the center chair, beckoning Flitwick to his side. Aside from the routine questions about how the morning had gone, however, they didn't talk. Snape didn't want Alecto to think he'd made the switch so that he could share confidences with Flitwick.

The Headmaster's office was a haven, but the Hall and the Staff Room were a maze of snares and quicksand. A long road stretched ahead of him, and Snape needed to tread carefully.

The afternoon was spent in a headmasters' conference.

"They are camping," was the first thing Dumbledore told Snape when he reentered the office. "Phineas heard them take a tent out of the bag." They waited, but there was no more information. In fact, though they didn't know it at the time, there would be almost no information about Potter other than the daily stowing and unpacking of the tent for several weeks.

That same afternoon, Dumbledore tried his first foray into a Famous Wizard card. He was back almost immediately. "The inside of a footlocker," he explained. "I could not even tell where, though I suspect one of the houses of Hogwarts."

A quick succession of similar trips earned mediocre results. Most of the chocolate frog cards were in desk drawers, photo albums, or shoe boxes. Occasionally they were on display in a bedroom. After many tries, Dumbledore returned from one excursion looking concerned.

"The Creeveys are in hiding," he told Snape. "The card belongs to Dennis, and he carries me in his pocket. They were ordered to report to the Ministry, and Colin and Dennis have taken their family into hiding."

As it turned out, after many more tries, a significant number of the students at Hogwarts carried Dumbledore's Famous Wizard card in their pockets. It was an encouraging discovery. Snape had no intention of doing anything at the moment, but at least they could get some idea of which and how many students were still loyal, in their own fashion, to Dumbledore.

Snape went to bed that night after a tiring day. A routine day, but a tiring one. The headmasters had learned nothing more about Potter and his friends.

Within a very short time, Snape realized that removing the muggle-borns from Hogwarts was probably a good idea. Alecto's curriculum in Muggle Studies turned out to be a hate-filled maligning of everything the muggle world had to offer, and Snape couldn't stop her, since the curriculum was approved by the Ministry. The only thing he could do was keep her from using the term 'mudblood' in class.

"Why can't I say 'mudblood?' It's what they are!"

Snape sighed. "Alecto, we are trying to convince the undecided of the wizarding world that these restrictions against muggle-borns are based on fact and on science. In order to do that, we must present our argument in a dispassionate and scientific way, with rhetoric devoid of the trappings of prejudice or racism. It must be presented as a logical, scientific position. Saying 'mudblood' undermines our efforts."

Alecto shrugged, and Snape doubted she understood words like 'dispassionate' and 'rhetoric.' "All right," she said, "but they're still mudbloods."

\emph{And why}, Snape thought later, \emph{did I do that? Don't I want to undermine our efforts?} And yet the greater part of himself was repulsed both by the word and its memories of Lily's shocked face, and by the idea that he was expected to drive a wedge between the supporters of the Dark Lord and those who would oppose him given the chance. Wasn't it good to have a supply of undecideds? Especially since now, with the Dark Lord in ascendance, to be undecided really meant to be on Dumbledore's side?

Amycus, meanwhile, was running into the brick wall of McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout.

"He's handing out detention right and left!" McGonagall was pacing Snape's office in high dudgeon. "Not just writing lines or cleaning desks, but canings! And for things he should simply be deducting points for, if anything. Gareth Armitage was given detention because he couldn't Imperius Florence Murphy on the first try! Imaging punishing students for not casting Unforgivable Curses!"

"I'll talk to him, Professor McGonagall."

"You had better! You had better start acting like the headmaster of this school instead of letting those two run roughshod over it." She nodded towards Dumbledore's portrait. "I know he and Alastor thought you were in their camp, but Albus would trust a ferret in a hen house, and I haven't heard anything from Alastor since the beginning of July. So I'll reserve my judgment until I see a bit of action."

"Thank you, Professor McGonagall. I shall take your remarks under consideration."

"Under consideration!" McGonagall approached Snape, trying to meet his eyes. "We used to have a wee bit more of a personal understanding than you just taking my remarks under consideration. Have ye lost your heart, lad? Have ye given them your soul?"

Snape did not, could not, reply. McGonagall marched to the door, turning to face him with her hand on the handle. "I'll no be giving Gryffindor students over to the mercy of Amycus Carrow. If you can't stand up to him like a man, I'll look for help elsewhere." For a moment she seemed to melt. "Och, Severus, what path have ye chosen to walk down? Can ye no turn around and choose another?" Then she steeled herself. "I'll fight ye, ye know. For the students' sake, I'll fight ye. If they take Hogwarts, it'll be over my dead body."

Snape watched her stomp away, and made no effort to call her back.

In the days that followed, Snape was faced with new challenges. These were generally of an administrative nature - the imbalance of class sizes, scheduling conflicts, unstable extending spells that were trying to fit eight students into dormitories meant for five - and with McGonagall teaching a full load of Transfiguration courses, it all fell on Snape.

After two weeks, most of the problems of opening school had been straightened out, and Snape decided to pay a visit to the Ministry of Magic to make a more immediate and personal plea for Slughorn's still missing supplies. On the way he stopped at headquarters.

"I'd like a meeting with the Dark Lord," he told the clerk as he signed in. "Can I do that here, or do I need to go to Wiltshire?"

The clerk looked nervous. "He's not seeing anyone, sir. He hasn't granted an interview since the last week in August. I'm sorry... I..."

"That's all right," Snape reassured him. "I can be patient."

"Well look who's here!" exclaimed a familiar voice, and Snape turned, his face already set into an artificial smile (more of a grimace, really) to greet Bella.

"A pleasure, as always, Mrs. Lestrange."

"I want to talk to you, Snape. It's about Alecto and Amycus. I hear you're restricting their actions and authority."

"I wasn't aware they had any authority outside the classroom, and I have been acquainting them with normal school procedures."

"Well, you need to give them more room, more scope. They have to be able to impose the Dark Lord's will..."

"How modest of you, Bella, to be willing to accept the menial role of messenger boy."

Bella colored, her face flushing a dangerous red. "Watch your mouth, puppy dog. I'm giving you orders."

"You don't give me orders. Hogwarts isn't Operations, and you're not part of its chain of command. The Dark Lord gives me orders."

"I'd think twice before taking that tone with me," Bella retorted. "As close as I am to the Dark Lord..."

"When was the last time you spoke to him, Bella?" Snape was pleased at the confusion on her face. Clearly she hadn't seen the Dark Lord since the end of August either.

"I know his mind," she countered. "I know his will."

"Can you stand here," Snape asked, his voice soft and threatening, "and tell me that you're relaying the Dark Lord's exact instructions? Because the first time I speak with him, I shall remember to ask. And if he finds out you're using his name to feather your own nest..." Snape didn't finish the sentence. Bella could work that out on her own.

Bella glared, but backed down. "Have a nice year at Hogwarts, puppy dog," she said as she walked away, down the corridor that led to Operations.

\emph{Why is the Dark Lord missing?} Snape thought as he left headquarters and found a secluded spot from which to apparate to the Ministry in London. \emph{It isn't like him to leave things to run themselves. Gives too much leeway to the mice.}

Solomon Whitgift of Personnel Administration and Supply was waiting to greet Snape at the public entrance to the Ministry of Magic. It had changed - the telephone booth was gone. Snape looked around as he shook Whitgift's extended hand and noticed unusual numbers of people heading down two flights of stairs to visit what his muggle father had called 'public conveniences,' and for some reason no one was coming back up. "You've remodeled," he commented to Whitgift.

"Had to expand the entrance," said Whitgift apologetically. "They've restricted Floo entry to the upper echelon, and we needed something that could accommodate more people."

When Snape entered with the token Whitgift gave him and saw that the Ministry workers were required to flush themselves through toilets to get inside, he knew at once whose idea it was. \emph{The Dark Lord does have a rather pedestrian sense of humor. There are more subtle ways to humiliate your fallen enemies, but I doubt he could think of them. A little ham-handed for my taste.} Snape suddenly realized he was thinking highly disparaging thoughts about the Dark Lord. \emph{Is that what happens when he leaves us? We start chipping away at the bars? Or is it the influence of Dumbledore and Nigellus? I need to be more careful about my thoughts.}

Snape spent a very unsatisfactory hour going from desk to desk and office to office trying to break the supply logjam. He did finally get the release forms for the animal parts by threatening to leave several cases of eyes in the Ministry to putrefy. The herbs and minerals were still on hold.

As he was leaving, he was hailed from across the Atrium. "Headmaster," the man called. "I'm so glad I caught you. I'm Forbes from Law Enforcement - Deeds and Wills. I'm sorry to trouble you, but we need to do some more tests on that sword."

"He's off somewhere doing something," Snape said that afternoon as he finished telling the portrait of Dumbledore about the Dark Lord's mysterious absence. "I'm sure of it."

"A brilliant deduction," said Dumbledore. "Most people are somewhere doing something."

"You know what I mean." Snape was beginning to realize that being in constant contact with Dumbledore wasn't as wonderful an experience as he'd originally thought. "If even Bella doesn't know where he is, who does?"

"Harry might," said Dumbledore, "but only because you could not teach him occlumency. It was," he confided to the other headmasters, "one of Severus's more spectacular failures."

"It wasn't my fault!" Snape exclaimed. "It was..."

"Of course it wasn't your fault, Severus. Nothing ever is."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"I mean that there are things you chose to do..."

"Name one."

"Very well, the prophecy, for example. You gave Riddle the prophecy."

"I was nineteen. I was being tortured. It wasn't a moment conducive to clairvoyance."

"Granted there were extenuating circumstances..."

Snape changed the subject. "I went to the Ministry, too. It was more obvious there. Thicknesse hasn't had any orders, and since he's Imperiused, he has trouble thinking of things on his own. His underlings don't understand why this is happening, but they're all rushing to fill the void. Supply hadn't completed our order for the Fall Term yet because they're trying to hoard everything they can. Magical Transportation wants to license broomsticks. And Law Enforcement wants to run some tests on Gryffindor's sword. 'More' tests he called it, so I thought it might be something you were already aware of."

"They want to look at the sword again?" said Dumbledore, puzzled now. "I was under the impression they checked it thoroughly in July."

"Why did they do that?" Snape asked, puzzled himself now, too.

"I left it to Harry in my will."

"You can't do that!" Snape almost laughed, he was so surprised. "That's not your personal property."

"I was rather hoping no one would notice," the portrait of Dumbledore sighed. "Harry must have the sword, you see. It is the one sure way of destroying the Horcruxes that I can give him. It is what I used to destroy that ring."

"The one that created this whole mess because you had to go and put it on? That ring?"

"Yes, Severus. That ring. There are other things that must be found. Harry must destroy them, and for that he needs the sword. Unfortunately, everything I left to Harry and his friends was examined by the Ministry, and they would not release the sword. And now that their attention has been drawn to the sword, it will be hard to get it out of Hogwarts and into Harry's hands without endangering you. They will notice it is missing, you see. They already want to look at it again."

"What can we do?" Severus asked, and the question was addressed to all the headmasters, who had shared all of Dumbledore's quests and his explanations to Harry Potter over the last year and more, and who knew as much about Horcruxes by now as anyone living.

It was Headmaster Fortescue who suggested a decoy sword. "A good replica to put in the case if anyone comes, and no one will know the real one is missing," he insisted.

"Don't be a jackass," Nigellus responded. "They want to test it. They've already tested it, and they want to test it again. If they ever test the replica, they'll know it's a fake. It won't work. It will just get poor Severus here into more trouble."

"At least someone," Snape remarked, "is worried about me."

"Still," commented Dippet, "the idea of a decoy could be used in other ways."

They hashed this around for a while. Headmistress Derwent sighed. "It's a pity you couldn't convince them that the sword had to be locked away somewhere safe. Then you could lock up the fake and hide the real one. Everyone would think the real one was out of reach and you could do what you want with it. But what's safer than the Headmaster's office at Hogwarts?"

The utter silence that followed this statement made Derwent look around nervously, as if they might all be laughing at her suggestion. Then Snape and Dumbledore said together, "Gringotts."

The first step was a delaying tactic. Snape got back to Forbes via the Floo network and said that since the time period for probating a will was long past, his request to run more tests on Gryffindor's sword could no longer be considered an extension of the original request, and he had to resubmit it in quadruplicate and present his case before the Board of Governors at their next meeting on October first.

That gave them barely two weeks to work on the replica, a job that Snape had to perform, as he was the only living wizard among them. He was carefully coached by the others, and though there were a few false starts, by September twenty-seventh he had produced a sword that would pass all but the most expert examinations.

"They'll know," Severus said morosely as the headmasters congratulated him on his achievement. "The goblins at Gringotts will know."

"Ah," said Dumbledore smiling, "this is true. But they will consider it a huge joke at your expense and will say nothing."

"Great!" replied Snape. "Every goblin in Gringotts, maybe in all of Britain, will be laughing at me."

"In a good cause, Severus. In a good cause."

Then came part two of the plan. Dumbledore had spent much of the same two weeks flitting through Famous Wizard cards. After four days he'd found the cards belonging to the second of Potter's trios - Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood. He reported back that the three of them were malcontent, convinced that Snape had murdered Dumbledore, and aching to do something to disrupt the new regime. They had just not yet figured out what.

"You are closer to these students than I, Severus," the portrait of Dumbledore admitted. "You taught them in close proximity for five, six years. Pick one."

It was an important decision. "I'd go for the Weasley girl as the leader," Snape said, "but I think she's too level headed to take advice from a chocolate frog card. Longbottom is too much of a self doubter to pass on what he heard. Lovegood, on the other hand, accepts the strangest things as true, so that she'll probably regard it as quite natural that chocolate frog cards are conspiring against the Dark Lord. Do you know that she once told me in front of an entire class of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs that the key ingredient in Pepper Up Potion was the powdered cartilage from the septum of a kangaroo?"

"Lovegood it is," said the portrait of Dumbledore.

By great good fortune, October first was also the new moon. It was thus a simple thing for Dumbledore to persuade Lovegood that the night for her and her companions to make their attempt was the night after the Board of Governors granted permission to the Ministry to reexamine the sword. Snape would be taking the sword to the Ministry the following day.

Any real thief would have been alerted at once by the ease with which the students got into the Headmaster's office and opened the glass case. Lovegood simply assumed it was the assistance of her chocolate frog card guide. The three were caught with the sword on the stairs between the fourth and the third floors by Amycus and Alecto Carrow, who were on patrol that night. The following late night session in the Headmaster's office was a stormy one, with the Carrows pitted against all four Heads of houses, the frightened students by the fireplace waiting for their fate to be decided, and Snape in the middle.

"They're in league with Potter!" Alecto screeched. "They've been in contact with Undesirable Number One and they were helping him! That's not just a breech of school rules! That's a criminal offense!"

"It was a prank, Professor Carrow," insisted McGonagall with fierce dignity. "If you cannot tell the difference between a child's prank and a crime then you should not be teaching in a school."

"They're conspiring against the Ministry of Magic," Amycus shouted, "and they'll go to Azkaban for it!" He smiled. "Though I'd rather handle the punishment here myself. I can get them to tell me where Undesirable Number One and his gang are."

"I have been in emergency contact with the Board," said Snape, and they all turned to him. "The Governors agree that in light of this serious, serious attack against the school, the sword of Godric Gryffindor will be taken tomorrow to a place of greater security, and the offenders need to be punished." He had not dared to confide any part of the plan to the Heads, and he prayed fervently that they would understand.

"In light of the gravity of their offense, they will be placed on detention and required to go into the Forbidden Forest to assist Professor Hagrid in his nonacademic duties."

McGonagall recoiled in surprise, and Flitwick and Sprout exchanged astonished glances. McGonagall recovered first and dove into her role with intense fervor. "Ye cannot send the poor children into the forest! 'Tis inhuman! Severus Snape, we do not punish children by sending them out as bait for wild animals, werewolves, and vampires! If you've a feeling heart in you, please give them some other punishment." Behind her, Weasley was clinging to Longbottom, and Lovegood was sobbing ostentatiously into the sleeve of her robes.

Snape was unmoved. "What I have decided," he said, "I have decided."

Alecto and Amycus wore expressions of glee. The students appeared terrified. Slughorn, Sprout and Flitwick followed them out in stunned silence, and McGonagall managed to flash Snape a wee smile and a quick wink as she, too, left the room.

The very next day, Snape apparated to the Ministry of Magic, Office of Deeds and Wills. He brought with him several things: the Sword of Godric Gryffindor; a Letter of Authorization from the Board of Governors permitting the Ministry of Magic to perform certain tests on the sword; an amendment to the authorization that stated that due to certain recent circumstances involving the safety of the sword, all tests were to be done in the physical presence of Hogwarts's Headmaster, and that the sword was to remain in the Headmaster's custody during the periods of time when the Ministry was not actually testing it; an order for a high-security vault at Gringotts Bank; and a small bag, altered by an Extension Charm, containing the replica sword.

It went like clockwork. The Ministry needed two days for its tests, so Snape got a room at the Leaky Cauldron and took the sword back there with him at night. The morning of the third day, the tests on the real sword now complete, Snape switched swords, putting the real one in the extendable bag and taking the replica to Gringotts. On leaving the Leaky Cauldron, he was met by Forbes from the Ministry, who accompanied him into Gringotts and watched as he handed the sword to the goblin clerk. The goblin smiled slightly as he lifted the sword, but said nothing.

On his return to Hogwarts, Snape placed the real sword in a newly made compartment behind Dumbledore's portrait. There was no way to get at the sword without Dumbledore knowing.

"Now all we have to do," sighed Dumbledore, "is find a way to let Harry know the importance of the sword, then plan how to get it to him." They briefed Nigellus on things he could say that would impart the necessary information and yet not appear that it was from Snape. "Harry, I fear," said Dumbledore, "would never act on information he thought originated with Severus. Are you certain, Phineas, that you cannot tell where he is?"

"I told you," grumbled Nigellus. "It's always the same. Quiet and rural. I can't learn anything except they're having trouble finding enough to eat and the... Granger girl is a terrible cook."

"Keep trying," said Snape wearily.

In the days that followed, Weasley, Longbottom, and Lovegood did their detention and returned from the Forbidden Forest, properly cowed and refusing to discuss what happened to them there. The Carrows went around looking pleased with themselves, and the rest of the staff treated Snape with guarded respect. Phineas Nigellus continued with his dull, unchanging reports until the moon had gone full cycle and was once again new and dark. Then, on the night of October twenty-eighth...

"She's calling me! The mudblood's calling me!" Nigellus suddenly screamed in the middle of an otherwise boring meeting, and before Snape could scold him, he was gone, but not before Dumbledore managed to yell, "Tell them about the sword!"

They waited. It seemed an hour, but it wasn't. Then Nigellus was back. "The mudblood blindfolded me!" was the first thing he said. "That wicked, disrespectful girl..."

"Phineas," Dumbledore asked patiently, "do they know about the sword?"

"Well, of course they know about the sword. Do you think I'm an idiot? Funny, I don't know why, they actually asked me about the sword. I didn't have to bring it up. I told them how it got its strength, and that Albus destroyed the ring with it. They wanted to talk to Albus, but I disabused them of that notion quickly enough. They were also worried about the three who stole it, and then they asked if I told Headmaster Snape about Albus using the sword. The girl thinks she's so clever, but she didn't notice that I didn't really answer the question. Ha!"

"Were all three of them there?" Snape asked.

"A girl and two boys," said Nigellus. "One of the boys was Potter. I recognized his voice. I ought to, I've heard it enough."

"And we still do not know where they are," said Dumbledore. "But at least we know that when we figure out how to get the sword to them, they will understand how to use it."

It was about the same time, just when things seemed to be going well concerning Potter, that Snape began to reap the harvest of his leniency with Weasley, Longbottom, and Lovegood. Apparently in the belief that they wouldn't be severely punished, students began rebelling all over the school. It was directed chiefly against Amycus and Alecto, but also against himself, and as October waned, Snape found himself with a real problem on his hands.

"Look at this!" Alecto shrieked, waving a copy of the Muggle Studies text, teacher's edition with curricular guidelines, in Snape's face. "They glued the pages shut! They damage my equipment! They erase the notices on the board! They post drawings of me all over the school!"

Amycus burst into the office then, for it was Snape's regular office hours, and the gargoyle could let anyone pass. Amycus's eyebrows were growing at an alarming rate. "Cursed!" he bellowed. "Cursed in my own classroom! I have the culprits, Snape, and they're going to be caned for this!"

"I think a lesser punishment..." Snape began, but Amycus strode behind the desk, practically toe to toe, a sneer on his lumpy face. They were not the same height, and Snape had to look up to meet Amycus's eyes.

"You know what I think, Headmaster," Amycus spat out. "I think you encourage them. I think you want us to look bad so you can shine. I've been talking to Bella, and she's making up a little list to give to Him when he gets back. How you're taking all the power to yourself and keeping Hogwarts out of the control of the Ministry or his people. You know what Bella thinks? She thinks you'd like to be the Dark Lord yourself."

The situation was now dangerous. Not knowing where the Dark Lord was, or what his mood would be on his return, knowing only from the mark on his arm that the Dark Lord was still alive and strong, Snape began to crack down on Hogwarts.

The students who'd cursed Amycus were caned, Snape insisting, however, that their Head of house (in this case McGonagall) be present to ensure that the punishment did not go beyond the allowed bounds. At dinner that evening, McGonagall refused to sit next to him, moving down the table to join Sprout and Sinistra instead. Part of Snape sympathized with, and part of him resented, her judgmental position.

\emph{I know you think I have choices, Minerva, but if the Dark Lord pulls me down, then Amycus Carrow will be in control not only of Hogwarts, but of Dumbledore, too, and everything will be lost. I don't see the choices. I only see consequences that I can't live with.}

And then it was Halloween. Snape ordered all the trappings: the cats and bats, the candles and jack o' lanterns, the apple and pumpkin pie, but his heart was not in it. For the first time in several years he truly felt the despair Lily's death had brought him sixteen years earlier, and realized it had never left him, just remained quiet and hidden, ready to return at any moment.

In the hours before the feast began, Snape retreated to his office, trying to sort out his position and his path, to deal with the isolation he felt, to deal with the pain of having to lose McGonagall, unable even to explain to her.

\emph{What is the nature of choice? When I choose to do one thing instead of another, what is the basis for my choice? Is it inwardly centered? Do I choose because I have to weigh the morality of one of my own actions against the morality of another of my own actions? Or is it outwardly centered? Do I weigh the outcome of one of my actions against the outcome of another of my actions?}

\emph{Look at the tower, at Dumbledore begging me to kill him. If my basis for action was inwardly centered, I would not have killed him. I would have refused. In that case, Dumbledore would still be dead, and I would be dead. Potter would be dead and the forces of the Dark Lord would have taken over, then and there. But I would have salvaged my own soul. At the cost of everyone else, I would have saved my soul.}

\emph{But I looked away from my soul and chose to kill Dumbledore, and that has altered everything. Dumbledore is still dead, but I live, Potter lives, and I still stand between the forces of the Dark Lord and his total dominance of Hogwarts. Is that a bad thing? Dumbledore does not think so. Perhaps I do not need to think so either.}

\emph{It is a most important question. Save my soul and lose the world, or lose my soul and save the world? I wish I could be sure that by losing my soul I really was saving the world. McGonagall disagrees. She thinks I'm presumptuous to believe that I can predict the outcome of my actions.}

\emph{Two and a half years ago, Dumbledore as much as told me he thought I should have been sorted into Gryffindor rather than Slytherin. 'We sort too soon,' he said. Did I have a choice there? I don't recall being given one. How would my life be different with no Bella or Rabastan, no Rosier, Wilkes, or Mulciber? Branded for life at the age of eleven, and McGonagall prats of choices.}

\emph{Maybe she expects me to act nobly, like some pasteboard hero in a book or a play. It would be so easy if the Dark Lord had to follow the same script. I could behave as recklessly as I wanted because no matter what I did, we'd all reach the predetermined end anyway and take our bows after the curtain closed. But I do not have the luxury of a self-indulgent morality. I have been assigned to walk through a mine field, and if I deliberately step on a mine to prove how brave I am, then I desert my post.}

The Halloween feast passed without incident. The students were laughing, fooling around, and demolishing treacle tarts. If Snape could have ignored the silent disapproval of the teachers, it would have been like every other Halloween feast (minus trolls, of course). He affected not to notice that he was being ostracized, and sat quietly back in his center chair, arms folded across his chest, watching the activity at the house tables, preferring isolation to the company of the Carrows.

As November progressed, the Carrows brought more and more accusations of conspiracies against themselves, the Headmaster, and the Ministry. Snape ordered a ban on the meeting of groups of more than three students, partly to prevent students from plotting, but equally to give the Carrows nothing that they could point to and use against the students. Snape knew perfectly well that the ban would never prevent the students from talking, especially when they slept eight or ten in a dorm room, but the Carrows didn't, and for a while things calmed down.

For some reason, Potter and his friends started talking to Phineas Nigellus more and more, and the portrait of Nigellus was permitted to feed them information in the hopes of extracting some from them, though Nigellus did tend to get huffy when they insulted Snape, knowing both sides of the situation as he did. After a while he reported a curious absence.

"I wasn't sure at first," Nigellus told Snape and Dumbledore, "because of course she continues to blindfold me, but I haven't heard the voice of the other boy at all. It seems like just Potter and the girl."

Which left them wondering what had become of Ron Weasley.

At the beginning of December, the Dark Lord returned. Snape and the Carrows were summoned to Wiltshire where the Dark Lord imposed his presence on the luckless Malfoys. It was no surprise to Snape that when he, Amycus, and Alecto entered, they were greeted by Bella Lestrange.

"There you are, Headmaster," Bella cooed. "I hope you have a wonderful report on Hogwarts. He isn't in the best of moods."

Snape gave her a mock smile. "I'm sure you've been busy paving the way for me."

"Don't I always?"

Bella entered the drawing room - where Charity Burbage had died - along with the three from Hogwarts, apparently secure in the knowledge that she was permitted to hear what Snape had to say. After a few minutes' wait, the Dark Lord entered from the far side of the room. He said nothing.

Faced with silence, the three immediately knelt on the carpet at his feet. Something was wrong, and Snape prayed it was not directed at him. "Tell us of Hogwarts, Headmaster," the Dark Lord said at last, and Snape was instantly wary. The use of the title was a sign of displeasure.

"Lord, everything goes according to plan. There are no muggle-borns at the school and enrollment has nearly doubled with all the pure- and half-bloods that now attend. The new curriculum is well received..."

"Why did you remove the sword of Godric Gryffindor from the school?"

Snape stopped. It was not the question he expected, and his answer was a split-second too late.

"Lord, the sword..." and then the pain hit. When it abated, Snape had fallen forward on his knees so that his hands touched the floor as well. His breath came in sharp gasps, and he dared not move or look around, though he was certain Bella would have an expression of pure delight on her face. A shark, circling in bloodied water.

"Do not consider your answer," the Dark Lord said. "Speak quickly and without guile."

"Lord, two things happened at the same time. First, the Ministry asked to reexamine the sword, a request approved by the Board, and then a small group of students attempted to steal the sword. They were caught in the act, but we felt it best to give the sword better protection."

"Why did they want the sword?"

Snape guessed that the Dark Lord was talking about the students. "They were once friends of Potter's," he said. "Their imaginations were overwrought."

"Were they punished?"

"Yes, Lord."

"And the sword?"

"Now lies in the vault of the Lestranges in Gringotts."

"So Bella assisted you in this?"

"Yes, Lord."

"You have been called over lenient."

"Forgive me, Lord, if I have erred. I understood that willing obedience was preferred to grudged coercion that might break out later in rebellion."

The Dark Lord turned his red slitted eyes to Bella and the Carrows. "This is no question of disobedience, but of subtlety," he said. Then to Snape, "Is it true you refused to accept Bella's advice and guidance, Severus?"

On surer ground now, Snape replied. "I asked her if her instructions came from you. She was unable to assure me that they did."

"It is well." At the Dark Lord's gesture, Snape rose to go, relieved it had not been worse. As he opened the door and stepped back into the foyer, he heard, "Bella, we leave again for a few days. Our path is obscure. It may be that in that time that you will hear from Nagini. If so, you will assist her at once. There is nothing else so important as that."

Back at Hogwarts, Snape reported to Dumbledore. \emph{At least here, he thought, I don't have to kneel.}

"So Riddle is separated from his snake," said Dumbledore. "That is most interesting news. I wonder what Nagini is doing."

Then came the Christmas break, and suddenly Hogwarts was empty.

In the days leading up to the end of term, Nigellus reported a change in Potter and Granger's actions. He'd noticed it because of Potter, who started waiting until Granger was asleep, then taking his rucksack out of her bag, sitting quietly for a while, then replacing the rucksack. At the same time, they acquired a new sense of energy in their voices, almost an excitement, but Nigellus was unable to get any clue of what they were planning.

Dumbledore began to instruct Snape about the sword. Not why Potter must have it, but how Potter must get it.

"The goblin-forged blade of Godric Gryffindor cannot be wielded by just anyone, Severus. It must be taken in an act of courage in a situation of great selfless need. Courage and chivalry, Severus. Only a true Gryffindor can use it."

Snape was fingering the ruby-encrusted hilt. "I suppose the touch of my loathsome Slytherin hands is polluting its purity."

The portrait peered over its glasses. "I doubt that very much. Think of the ideal of medieval chivalry - devotion to a lady, pure and unobtainable. I think we have that. And courage. Who else among us would have walked into Riddle's presence two and a half years ago, knowing he was about to face torment and possible death, forbidden to fight back? My dear boy, that is the kind of courage mere warriors never understand. You would have done well in Gryffindor."

With a snort of contempt, Snape laid the sword back on the table. "Can you imagine me sharing a dorm room with Sirius Black and James Potter? The thought makes my skin crawl. And what point is there to being a dunderheaded bully, smashing my way through life and roaring like an idiot on a overdose of testosterone?"

"You are right, Severus. You may be too intellectual for Gryffindor. Still, I think we sort too soon."

The most important thing, however, other than Potter's actually getting the sword, was that under no circumstances could he know that Snape was involved. Given Potter's feelings about Snape, it might interfere with his willingness to take the sword, but vitally more important was Potter's total lack of ability as an occlumens.

"If he ever comes face to face with Riddle, and Riddle sees the connection between you and the sword, then we are undone. Harry would have to vanquish Riddle at that moment, or you would die, Hogwarts would lose its protector, and I would be taking orders from Amycus Carrow. Not a pretty picture, that."

"No, sir," Snape agreed. "Not one I care to contemplate, certainly." He was working out how he might accomplish the task of giving Potter the sword, under conditions of daring and need, without being seen. He already had an idea.

Something had happened to Snape the night, a year and a half earlier, when he'd faced Sirius Black for the last time over the green Floo connection in Dolores Umbridge's office at Hogwarts. He could still hear himself pleading with Sirius not to go to the Department of Mysteries, and he could still hear Sirius's reply: "No! He's James's son! For Chris'sake, Severus, he's Lily's son! And he's the closest thing to my own son I'll ever have. Dammit, I love him!" And his own voice responding, \emph{Good luck}.

Sirius Black died that night, and something inside Severus opened for the first time. For the first time he faced the possibility that what he felt for Lily after all these years could, in fact, be called love. He rejected the thought at first, refusing to admit that love existed, calling it friendship, affection, anything but the word that everyone threw around so glibly and so meaninglessly - but it would not go away.

It wasn't until well into that summer, when he wanted to send Dumbledore a patronus message, that the full import of what had happened hit him. His patronus had changed. Instead of the clever little fox that he was used to, his wand spurted forth an image he'd never seen before, the image of a beautiful fallow doe, dainty and graceful, that leapt and pranced around him playfully, as if joyful at finally being released.

\emph{Where did you come from?} Snape had thought, staring aghast at the lovely creature so unlike himself. Then it hit him. James Potter was 'Prongs' to his friends. His patronus must have been a stag. The doe, then, was Lily.

Instead of being pleased, Snape was horrified. True, the Death Eaters never communicated by patronus. Snape doubted if the majority of them could produce a patronus. But the fact of this patronus was now both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because he could conjure it, and it would skip about him, so full of affection that it made even Snape feel, well not tenderness exactly, but less alone. A curse because that patronus, produced in front of the Dark Lord, or Bella, or Macnair, was a death sentence. The only other person who knew of it was Dumbledore.

Now, however, he had a task, and Snape was, if nothing else, dedicated to the accomplishment of the tasks set before him by Dumbledore.

So, when Nigellus came tumbling back into his portrait the morning of Friday, December twenty-sixth, bellowing, "Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean!" Snape had already worked out the basics of what he was going to do.

It was cold in the Forest of Dean. It was bitterly cold, and Snape dared light no fire to warm his numb fingers for fear Potter or Granger might see it. He himself had not yet seen them. What he had seen, after several hours of trying to detect protection and concealment spells, was Ron Weasley.

\emph{What is he doing back? And more to the point, if he is back, why doesn't he go right to Potter and Granger?} The only possible answer was that Weasley had no way to communicate his presence to the other two. And yet he was here, amazingly, inexplicably, here. That must mean that Potter and Granger were somewhere near as well.

Night fell, and a soft light snow began to drift through the trees overhead. The cold was like a metal clamp around Snape's head, but still he searched until finally, mercifully, he felt the vague, insubstantial hum of a Muffliato spell. It was unmistakable, probably because it was a spell he'd invented himself. \emph{The little monsters stole that from my spell book. Well, at least it has served a purpose and allowed me to locate them.}

Snape retreated into the woods hampered by a pitch blackness that was partly due to the clouds that brought the snow, and partly because the moon was almost new and would not rise until well after five o'clock. Finally forced to use his wand, he murmured \emph{"Quaero aquam!"} and followed the resulting pinpoint of light to a pool of water, full from recent rain, that was already covered with a thin layer of ice from the cold. It was about four feet deep, shallow enough to stand in, but deep enough so that anyone wanting to retrieve an object from the bottom would have to submerge himself entirely.

\emph{I know, Dumbledore, that bending down in chest deep water isn't normally considered the height of courage, but you have no idea how cold it is here. He could freeze to death before he got back to the tent.}

Snape took Gryffindor's sword from his pouch and paused, considering how to get it to the middle of the pool. Simply throwing it wasn't an option since, besides being disrespectful to the sword (never be disrespectful to a goblin-made sword), he wasn't sure if the weight of the sword was sufficient to break through the ice. Instead he broke the ice with a spell, then levitated the sword into position and gently lowered it. \emph{Now to get Potter!}

Almost as soon as he cast the patronus, Snape knew his instincts had been correct. Out of the thin air of a concealment spell, Potter appeared, attracted by the shimmering light. He seemed entranced by the image of the doe, and Snape had to admit that the patronus was softer, gentler, lighter than usual. Snape was at a loss to explain why this might be, unless the tiny vestige of Lily that must still animate the doe recognized the presence of Lily's son. It gave Snape a chill that had nothing to do with the exterior cold.

After a moment, Snape had the doe turn and lead Potter through the trees in the direction of the pool. After first calling to her to return, Potter followed like a man in a dream. Just beyond the pool, Snape slipped behind two oaks that grew closely enough together that, in his dark clothing, he would be able to watch unseen. He had to be sure Potter succeeded before he could leave.

The patronus and the boy reached the pool, Potter stepped forward as if to speak, and Snape let the doe vanish. There was silence, then the word \emph{"Lumos!"} and then the illumination of faint green light. Potter glanced around him, and saw the sword.

He stared. He knelt in the snow before it. He scanned the surrounding woods while Snape crouched behind his trees to avoid detection. He circled the pool like a stalking panther. Then he seemed to steel himself.

Dumbledore had been right. Potter knew exactly what to do. After a moment's understandable hesitation, he began to strip down to his underwear in the freezing cold. He laid everything aside, shoes, glasses, wand, a pouch he had slung around his neck, everything but his underwear and something that gleamed gold on his chest. A Diffindo spell broke the congealing ice and, not trusting himself to ease slowly in, Potter jumped into the pool. He stood shivering in chest deep water for a moment, then ducked under.

What happened next was so utterly unexpected that at first Snape couldn't react from the shock. Potter began to thrash and kick in the pool as if fighting an enemy. But there was no enemy there. The pool, as Snape knew, was empty but for the sword. \emph{Could the sword have attacked Potter?} There was no time to lose, or Potter would drown. Snape struggled to his feet, but someone else moved faster. Bushes crashing as he pushed them aside in his wild haste, Ron Weasley dashed from the trees and flung himself into the water. In a matter of seconds, Potter was back on the ground, clutching at his throat, and Weasley was back in the water groping for the sword, which he used to cut whatever was strangling Potter.

Snape waited only long enough to be sure Potter was alive and conscious, and then he slipped silently away from the oaks, obliterating his footprints as he went, and returned to Hogwarts.

Dumbledore had a fire roaring, and Snape crouched down on the hearth to warm his icy, numb body before saying anything. Then he stood and faced the portrait. "If I've been frostbitten and lose my toes, it's your fault," he snapped.

"Does Potter have the sword?" Dumbledore asked, ignoring the accusation.

"No. Something went wrong, and he almost died. Weasley saved him. Weasley's back, he saved Potter's life, and he retrieved the sword."

"Then Ron must wield the sword," said Dumbledore. "Dear me, I hope Harry is wise enough to realize that."
