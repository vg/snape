\subsection{Chapter 13: Chapter 13 â€“ Independence}

\textbf{A Difference in the Family: The Fourth Year - Independence}

\emph{Tuesday, October 15, 1974 (the new moon)}

It is highly probable that the Hogwarts academic year of 1974-1975 started out the same as usual. It is highly probable that Gryffindor and Slytherin engaged in mortal combat on and off the Quidditch pitch, and that the familiar names of Black, Potter, Lestrange, Snape, Lupin, Rosier, and Pettigrew were heralded as champions of their respective houses. It is highly probable that curse met curse, hex met hex, jinx met jinx, and practical jokes reached a height of cleverness and cruelty never before experienced by the student body at Hogwarts. Highly probable, but not provable, for in all the years to come, Severus was never able to remember those first six weeks, not after the events of the fifteenth of October.

Kettleburn's Care of Magical Creatures classes ended that Tuesday at midmorning, and the students started to filter back to the castle. Severus had an appointment to see Hagrid, but it was on a routine matter and he hoped to be mostly free until luncheon. When he entered the hut, however, he could tell that Hagrid was upset about something, Hagrid never having been able to hide his emotions in all the time that Severus had known him.

"I hope ya got some free time, 'cause Dumbledore's got somewhat t' say t' ya. I'm supposed t' take ya up there now."

Severus was puzzled, but followed Hagrid into the castle without protest. They climbed the stairs to the entrance to the Headmaster's Tower in silence punctuated only by Hagrid's sniffles. A muttered password, a ride up the moving spiral stair, and they were in Dumbledore's domain. Severus was a little surprised to see Professor Slughorn there as well, but assumed his presence would be explained.

"Ah!" said Dumbledore on seeing him. "Master Snape. Please, would you sit down?"

Severus sat in the proffered chair, aware that no one but Dumbledore seemed to want to look at him. Dumbledore sat in a similar chair facing him. "I am most grieved at having to impart this information to you, but we have received very bad news that concerns you. I am sorry but... your parents have died."

Severus sat quietly looking at Dumbledore for several seconds, wondering why the Headmaster was telling him this. Certainly a student's parents were dead, but he didn't know this student, and there was nothing he could do, so why would Dumbledore inform him? He glanced at Hagrid for assistance, but Hagrid was beginning to cry, and was therefore of no use. He looked back at Dumbledore with a slight smile and started to form his question - and then it hit him. Mum was dead. Dad was dead. He could feel the blood draining from his face, and for a moment he feared he was going to faint. Hagrid stepped behind him and placed a hand on his shoulder. Severus was beginning to tremble. Dumbledore leaned forward, laying a hand on his wrist. His breathing was difficult. His heart was pounding. He looked at Dumbledore with frightened eyes.

"What happened?' he whispered.

"There was, as I understand, an accident with their automobile. They were both killed."

"That's impossible. Dad only used the car to find jobs. Mum never rode with him. There's no reason they would be together."

"And yet, tragically, it seems they were. I am to take you back to your home. Hagrid will accompany us. We shall be met there by your grandmothers."

They apparated to the edge of town near the Snape house, then walked the rest of the way. Severus was suddenly horribly embarrassed that Dumbledore should be seeing where his parents had lived, the poverty and the squalor. He wished that Dumbledore had not come. Then Gra saw them and came trotting out, small and dumpy. Nana was thin and pinched looking, and the house was a working-class hole.

They walked through the door and into the sitting room. It seemed strangely empty, even though everything he remembered was still there. Severus excused himself to go with Gra to brew some tea, but in the narrow hall at the foot of the stairs he stopped, rooted to the spot. There in the threadbare rug was a stain that hadn't been there before. A reddish-brown stain, roughly circular, about a foot in diameter.

Hearing the silence, Dumbledore rose and joined them, Hagrid and Nana behind him. Severus and Gra were staring at the floor, so Dumbledore looked, too. "Dear, dear," he said calmly. "Master Snape, would you come back into the parlor with me? Mrs. Snape, do you think you might go to one of the neighbors? I think we need to find out what happened here."

Mrs. Hanson came, as did several of the men who still lived on the street. They stood nervously before Dumbledore, caps in hand. Ted Murphy did most of the talking.

"He come home late in the afternoon all liquored up. He 'd of been longer at the pub, but he run out of money. Near 's we can tell, she got him into bed, but he was up again a couple of hours later and they was going at it. Seems he hit her at the top of the stairs and she fell all the way and cut her head open.

"Next I know he's banging on my door begging for a can of petrol for the car 'cause he's got t' get her t' the doctor next town. I helped him put her in the front seat, and she was breathing kind of ragged. Toby, he was beside hisself. Kept calling to her, asking her not t' leave him, calling hisself the worst kind of villain, he was that overcome. I never seen him so scared.

"He seemed all right to be on the road. It ain't like there's any cars on the roads now, but he hit a turn too fast and took the car into a ditch. Don't know as he ever hit the brake. They both died right there. Terrible thing."

And it was a terrible thing, but it was done, and life had to go on. The neighbors went home. Mrs. Hanson offered to look after Severus, but Gra said he was coming to stay with her for a few days. Nana concurred and was the first to leave, apparating from the upstairs landing. Dumbledore took charge of locking up the house, putting charms on all the doors and windows to keep the meager possessions safe.

Normally one did not apparate with muggles, but Gra was a special case. Dumbledore escorted her home, then returned for Severus, sending Hagrid back to Hogwarts. Once Severus was settled into a little room next to Gra's kitchen, Dumbledore also left, letting grandmother and grandson share their grief in privacy.

Hours later Gra had gone to sleep and Severus sat in his strange new room on a strange bed with a candle to keep him company, thinking of what had happened. A fat fly buzzed in one corner, and he pointed his wand at it and shot it down. He believed the men's story. It was so like his father to strike out first and regret later. Then when Eileen fell, Toby would be distraught. In all his life Severus had never known his parents to spend a day apart. His dad couldn't live without his mum. Another fly buzzed, and he shot that one down, too.

So Toby would have run, panic-stricken, to the neighbors for help getting Eileen to a doctor, blaming himself for everything. Begging his unconscious wife not to leave him. More terrified of living without her than of dying himself.

That was why Severus knew, more than anyone, what had happened on that road that night. There had been no accident. No drunken, laid-off coal miner had taken a curve too fast on the way to the hospital and wound up in a ditch. No, his dad never had a chance to get to a doctor; his mum had died in the car on the way, and his dad knew it. Unable to face even a minute with the stark knowledge of his guilt and loss, Toby had pointed the car at that ditch, stepped on the accelerator, and joined Eileen.

All that night Severus sat alone in the dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies...

\emph{Halloween, Thursday, October 31, 1974 (the full moon)}

Severus returned to Hogwarts on Halloween. He apparated into Hogsmeade early in the evening with Nana, and together they walked up the hill to the castle. Severus was thinner and paler than before, dressed in school gown, robe, biretta, and cloak, but Nana looked like a dowager empress.

Head and shoulders above Severus in height and slender as a greyhound, Nana moved with the natural dignity of one born to the throne. Her gown was as straight and plain in its cut as Severus's except for the fullness of the bishop sleeves, but it was of royal blue moire silk, with collar, cuffs, belt, and hem embroidered in silver, pearls, and tiny beads of lapis lazuli. The satin robe was the same shade of blue, with shortened, wide draping sleeves that revealed the gown underneath, but cut straight in an oriental fashion that did not billow as she walked. A matching tricorne hat swathed in a sapphire ostrich plume sat jauntily on her head, a large brooch of crystal and sapphire holding the feather in place. Blue satin slippers adorned her feet, and over all she had a midnight blue velvet cape. Nana wore no other jewelry, but in her left hand she carried an ebony walking stick nearly as tall as she was, banded in silver and topped by a raven, its wings spread in challenge, carved in jet with garnet eyes.

All had been made for Nana's own great-great-grandmother Rossendale to wear to the coronation of George III, and it lay in a small trunk in her attic until needed to put on a show at Hogwarts, but having only been worn once before, it had the look and feel of something new. "Stand up straight," Nana whispered to Severus as they stepped into the empty entrance hall, "and hold your head up. We may not be rich, but we come from families as old as any here."

The Halloween feast was well under way, and many of the staff and students were dressed in formal robes for the occasion. The heavy doors swung silently open, and Nana advanced a few steps into the Great Hall, Severus at her right side, her arm around his shoulders. There they waited, unmoving, as Dumbledore rose from the high table and came to greet them while quiet spread through the hall.

"Constantina, it is an honor to welcome you here," exclaimed Dumbledore as he bent to kiss her outstretched hand. "My pleasure for the evening is now complete."

"It is good to see you, too, Albus," replied Nana. "It has been far too long." Which, since they had only met two weeks earlier, was a slight exaggeration, but a show is a show.

A house-elf appeared to take the cloak that Nana let fall from her shoulders to the floor. Dumbledore turned to Severus. "Welcome back to Hogwarts, Master Snape. We have missed you. I am sure that you would like to join your comrades in Slytherin, but I am going to be selfish enough to ask your grandmother to grace my own table."

Severus nodded and went to the Slytherin table, where Bella pushed Rodolphus out of the way to make room for him." How does your grandmother know Dumbledore?" whispered Bella.

"I'm not sure. She didn't attend Hogwarts." This led to rampant speculation that Severus's grandmother had been educated in France, a rumor he never bothered to contradict.

When the feast was over, Severus kissed Nana goodbye and went to his dormitory, where he was treated with a new respect as befitted the romantic nature of his sudden departure and dramatic return. Dumbledore accompanied Nana down the hill to a point where she could apparate back to her home in Lancashire. The quiet night was a perfect place to talk.

"We don't know what to do. You saw him - he isn't eating. He barely speaks. He lies in bed half the day sleeping or just staring at the wall. He used to be a fighter. Now he's given up. I couldn't let him slink back into school like a whipped dog, thus this little charade. Thank you so much for playing along."

"It will be a nine-day wonder at the very least. Everything he does or doesn't do will be attributed to romantic moodiness. I am concerned about his depression, though. It is not healthy in one so young. Has he shown no interest at all in any outside things?"

Nana shook her head. "It's as if he's built a wall around himself. No one gets in, and he won't come out."

After Nana disapparated, Dumbledore walked slowly back up the hill pondering what he might do.

\emph{Wednesday, November 6 to Friday, November 8, 1974 (the last quarter)}

Severus stopped going to see Hagrid, so Hagrid was forced to go to Severus. This was not as easy as it sounded, for Hagrid never entered the four houses, and Severus had stopped attending most of his classes. About a week after Severus's return, Hagrid managed to catch him outside his Dark Arts class. Hagrid seized his elbow and marched him down to the hut. Severus made no attempt to resist.

Hagrid was appalled at Severus's condition. Thin and haggard already, the boy was beginning to get slovenly. His hair was unwashed, and his robes wrinkled from sleeping in them. He submitted with a frightening passivity to Hagrid's checkup, not saying a word all the while.

"Ya've got to start taking better care of yerself," said Hagrid. Severus shrugged. "I'm serious. Y're way too thin, and ya look a mess. Ya keep on like this and ya'll end up in hospital."

Bella accosted Severus when he returned to the Slytherin common room. "Hey, Snape. You really have to join us. Rosier's birthday is coming up and we're planning a party." Severus stared at her blankly, then walked without a word into his dormitory. Bella's voice followed him. "You've got to snap out of this. I know you feel bad, but this is going too far."

Severus lay on his side on his bed, staring at the wall. He wanted to sleep. When he was asleep, he didn't feel anything. Nothing else mattered. He closed his eyes.

Lily managed to contact him two days later. `Lake' the note said, and for the first time Severus felt like he might want to talk to someone. Lily was his friend, his only real friend. Lily would understand.

They stood by the lake in the deepening afternoon, skipping rocks across the water. Severus told Lily some of what had happened, how his mother had fallen on the stairs, and how his father had tried to get her to the doctor, and how the car had gone off the road. He didn't tell her the other part, why it happened. He'd never talked much about his parents to Lily before, and there were things he didn't want her to know.

"That's terrible. No wonder you feel so bad. It's good you still have your grandmother to live with."

Severus had forgotten that Lily would have seen Nana on Halloween. He didn't really want Lily to try to make him feel better. He wanted her to understand his sorrow. "It isn't the same thing. She's nice, both of them are nice, but it isn't the same as Mum and Dad."

"Still, you do have family to go to. Not everyone has that."

"I'll never be able to play cribbage with Dad again, never practice dueling with Mum..."

"You'll have other things. There's still the space program, and your science. You have a lot of things to keep you interested."

"Why don't you care how I feel?"

"I do care. I'm trying to make you feel better."

"No, you're trying to make me feel the way you think I should. I'm the one who just lost his parents!"

"And you need to start getting over it. Look at you! You look awful! And you smell!"

"I offend you. I'm sorry if losing my parents offends you. I thought you were my friend."

"I am your friend. And sometimes friends have to tell the truth!"

Severus felt a terrible emptiness in the center of his being, as if part of him no longer existed. He fought to get that part back. "Friends aren't supposed to act like this. If you were my friend, you'd be nice to me, you'd understand, you'd treat me better," he yelled at her.

She yelled back. "Well maybe that's why you don't have so many friends!"

Then it happened. His right hand was up across his chest and he struck Lily with the back of it on the right side of her jaw. She staggered back, a look of outraged fury on her face. He stared dumbly at her and at his own hand as the horror of it slowly dawned on him. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "Lily, I'm sorry..."

"You hit me! How dare you! You hit me!"

"I didn't mean... I didn't want... Please, Lily, I'm sorry. ...I won't ever..." but she backed away from him as if he were some kind of beast, then turned and ran back up the hill to the castle.

Behind her, Severus sank onto the narrow stretch of sand and buried his face in his hands.

Severus knew now the full import of what had happened. He was in every way his father's son. Tobias Snape had carried a demon inside him, a demon that made him lash out at and finally destroy the thing he loved most in the world. That demon lived in Severus, too. He carried it in his blood like a disease. He had one real friend in the world and he'd struck her, struck as his dad had so often struck his mum, for facing him with honesty and truth. And in the moment that his hand hit her jaw, he'd felt a visceral sense of power and completeness that thrilled through his very being. The demon thrived on it. Severus had never felt so ashamed of himself in his life.

The demon had an image. An image that brooded in the pure cleanliness of the laboratory and mocked his dreams - the image of a double helix. The double helix resided in every cell of his body, half from Toby and half from Eileen. Toby's half was the demon that lived in his blood, his bones, his skin. There was no escape. He was genetically doomed to destroy what he loved.

Hours passed as he struggled with the demon, and slowly the solution came to him. As long as he never loved anything, he could not destroy it. Anger could be controlled. Frustration, envy, pride, could all be controlled. Only love woke the sleeping demon and beckoned it from its hiding place. Deep inside, the doors that Hagrid and Dumbledore had worked so hard to open began to close again.

Around suppertime it began to rain, but Severus didn't appear in the Great Hall. Lily looked for him, hoping for the opportunity to snub him, and was disappointed that he didn't come. After twenty minutes, Dumbledore signaled to Hagrid, for they were trying to ensure that the boy at least ate regularly, and Hagrid went out of the hall.

A little later Hagrid returned, shaking his head. Dumbledore rose and passed through the hall next to the Gryffindor table. "Miss Evans," he said when he reached her place on the bench, "I am sorry to interrupt your meal, but may I have a word with you?"

They went into the entrance hall where they could speak undisturbed. "We are trying to find Master Snape. I know that at one time the two of you were friends, and I was hoping you might know where he was."

"No, sir," she replied, yet Dumbledore could feel the uncertainty in her manner, and noticed quite suddenly that there was the tiniest hint of something - swelling? - along her jaw.

"We are very worried about him. You may have noticed a change since his parents died, and we are concerned that he is all right. He is not at supper, and he is not in Slytherin house."

Lily wrestled for a moment with her own demons, but they were weak and puny in comparison with her heart. "We were down by the lake," she said. "We had an argument and... he hit me."

Dumbledore and Hagrid exchanged a glance, then Hagrid said, "I'm on it," and left at once. Dumbledore stayed with Lily.

"I hope you are not hurt. I am most grieved to hear that he struck you, both for your sake and for his. Has he told you what happened to his parents?"

"His mother fell on the stairs, and when his father was taking her to the hospital, they had an accident with the car."

"Ah, yes." Dumbledore concealed his disappointment. The girl could be of so much help if she understood more, but he could not violate the boy's confidence by telling her more than Severus wanted her to know. They were, after all, the boy's parents. "Would you do me a favor? Would you stay here until Hagrid brings Master Snape back? It may do much good."

Hagrid found Severus lying by the lake, soaked and chilled to the bone. The boy protested as he was lifted, but Hagrid could tell that he was already becoming feverish and wasted no time. He lumbered up the hill, through the entrance hall, and up to the first floor hospital wing, Dumbledore and Lily now in his wake, to deposit Severus into the care of the new, young nurse, Miss Pomfrey.

Quickly they stripped the wet robes and wrapped him in warm woolen blankets. Dumbledore heard a small gasp behind him and turned, already knowing that Lily had seen the scars. Carefully he steered her away from the patients' area. "There is much that I wish I could tell you, Miss Evans, but it is, alas, not my story to tell. Do you think you might hold yourself ready in case he decides to tell you himself?"

Lily nodded, and set herself to wait.

It turned out that Severus was in no danger, just wet and cold, and what fever he had was quickly brought under control. Dumbledore decided, however, that it would be better to keep him in the hospital wing for a few days, where he, Hagrid, and Miss Pomfrey could monitor him better, especially his food intake. Hagrid stood off to one side while Dumbledore talked to the boy.

"Now how did you happen to be sitting in the rain by the lake?"

"I was talking to a friend."

"Your friend was no longer there."

"She left."

"She must have realized it was getting near supper time, or that the weather was turning chill."

"No. I did... something bad."

Dumbledore waited patiently. Admitting a wrong was a step toward healing. Concealing it was a whole other problem.

"I... lost my temper. I hit her. In the face."

"With your fist?"

"No. Like that." Severus made a quick gesture with the back of his hand. He was deeply embarrassed that he had to answer these questions, but it was his own fault.

"And why did you decide to hit her?"

"I didn't decide to. I just did it. She made me angry."

"Really."

Severus thought about this for a while, remembering the times his mum had been the target and his dad the attacker. "No, not really. She was trying to help. I was angry. She wasn't doing what I wanted her to do, but that wasn't her fault. I won't ever do it again."

Dumbledore was relieved. No excuses, no attempts to justify his actions. Maybe the situation was not as serious as he'd feared. "Let us hope not, Master Snape," he said, rising to leave. "You get some rest now."

The conversation with Lily was slightly different.

"I am so sorry..."

"You should be. I don't let people hit me."

"I said I was sorry. You're supposed to..."

"Like I was supposed to be nice to you and treat you better? Because that's what friends are supposed to do?"

"Well, yeah, because..." Severus stopped. That was where the demon had appeared. That was where he'd lost control. "Well, no. I mean, you shouldn't have to do things just because I think it's what's supposed to happen. Anyway, it won't happen again."

"It better not."

"It won't. Pax?"

"Pax."

What it boiled down to, Severus decided as he lay awake in the hospital wing, was that there were things that you could have in life, and things that you couldn't. There were things that people like the Blacks took for granted because they were rich that Severus would never dream of wanting. It was just not part of his life. He could watch it, and enjoy it, but having it would make him grotesque, like a fish trying to live on land.

So it was in the world of emotions. There were some people who were born to love. There were others, like Toby, like himself, who had forfeited this right by the circumstances of their birth. The double helix never lied. If you tried to resist the dictates of its destiny, you'd destroy what you most wanted to preserve.

The sooner you realized that and learned to live with it, the better.

There is nothing less romantic in the world than lying in a hospital bed staring at a privacy screen. The soft, enticing melancholy of his dormitory cocoon was impossible in the white world of crisp linen and bedpans. Lily didn't come again, but that was understood, for the hospital wing was too open and exposed to casual observation. Severus couldn't leave until Dumbledore allowed it. After one day Severus was bored.

Bella sent books, two of them. One was \emph{Creatures of the Inner Darkness}, which was infinitely better than the grindylows and red caps of his Defense against the Dark Arts class. Here he found the seven ways to become a vampire, learned that there were weretigers as well as werewolves, discovered incubi and succubi, changelings, harpies, doppelgangers, zombies, ghouls, and lamiae. Around him teemed a vast ocean of nocturnal life, invisible to those who walked in the mundane light of midday.

The other book was \emph{Wands from a Lightning-Blasted Oak}, about all sorts of enchanted items. Severus's old friend, the Hand of Glory, was in it, along with candles made from human tallow, weather changers, cursed rings, and several different kinds of blood writing.

Severus devoured both books within two days. It was as if a part of himself that had always been empty were becoming whole. He understood it now. He, too, was a dark creature, born for the midnight hours under the full moon. He carried that darkness within, a gift and a curse from Toby. Maybe he would never be able to share the world of light and love, but there was another world that he was welcomed into.

Among the enchanted items in \emph{Wands from a Blasted Oak} was an assassin's knife that could be sent anywhere to attack an enemy. Severus studied the description for several minutes before the idea hit him. Why do you need the knife? Can't you do that with just a spell?

The next morning Dumbledore freed him from prison, and Severus raced to his dormitory to pull out Eileen's old sixth-year potions book.

Severus's dorm mates noticed the change, or at least they noticed some change. "Hey, Snape," Mulciber said as Severus entered the room and headed straight for his footlocker, "Snape, you got a minute?"

Although he didn't really want to talk to Mulciber, Severus went over to the bed where he was lying on his stomach reading a book. "Yeah?" he answered.

"You okay?"

Severus regarded Mulciber calmly. Although he'd never tried to be friendly the way Edison sometimes did, he'd also never teased the way Wilkes did. After the death of Toby and Eileen, Severus had a vague recollection that Mulciber 'd even made sure the others left him alone. "Sure," he replied.

Mulciber turned on his side, head leaning on one hand. "Do you know how to give Ian Scorsone a pimple? A big one, right on the side of his nose?"

Scorsone was a fifth year Slytherin prefect. "Why do you want to do that?" Severus asked, contemplating the possibilities.

"I want Alderton to go to Hogsmeade with me, but she's soft on Scorsone. I figure one big pimple..."

Severus smirked. Wilhelmina Alderton had acquired a reputation for going with anyone who would buy her a butterbeer. If something like a pimple could interfere with her affections... "Papula," said Severus. "Point right at his nose and say, Papula."

"Thanks, mate. I owe you one."

Severus went outside to attend to his own business. Making spells for lice and spiders was easy. The knife spell took until the Christmas break to work out. Severus tried different words in different languages. He tried twirling, tapping, and slashing with his wand. He moderated his voice from loud to whispered, even a nonverbal command.

The first time his Sectumsempra spell worked was against a sapling at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. There, in the ice and snow and gathering darkness, he watched in horror as the slender tree was slashed to pieces in a matter of seconds. \emph{What if I had tried that on a person?} Severus felt sick.

There was no time to work on it, though. Christmas break was coming and Bella once again invited him to the Black house for the holidays. He wasn't sure why, since she'd passed her OWL in potions, but he decided to accept anyway. He wanted to see London again. Maybe he wanted to see Narcissa again.

Severus examined his feelings for Narcissa very carefully and felt he was safe. He didn't love her. She was beauty, grace, and tender sorrow, but she was not and never would be for him. She couldn't wake his demon any more than the marble, gilt, satin, or velvet could tempt him to leave Nana and Gra.

Christmas break came, and Severus left with Bella. He took with him the two books that had been Bella's hospital gifts, and he took his mother's potions book. He was planning on working over the holidays.

The Black residence hadn't changed. There was the same grandeur, the same frosty politeness, the same upstairs room, and the same almost total privacy. There were far worse ways to live. There was also Narcissa, and two days after Severus arrived she began to make her plans clear.

"How much do you know of London, Severus?" They were in the conservatory where she'd asked him to join her for tea.

"Almost nothing. I have to go through King's Cross Station and Euston Station every year, but that's about it."

"Well then I have to show you London. What kinds of things are you interested in?"

Severus wanted to say `science,' but he was aware of Narcissa's limitations. So he said `history' instead.

"Great!" replied Narcissa, and told her family at dinner that she was taking Severus the next day to see the Tower of London.

The Tower presented a challenge, for they couldn't simply apparate into it. Every part of it was so crowded that apparation would unavoidably attract the attention of muggles. Mrs. Black kept a small amount of muggle money with her household accounts in case of emergencies, and Narcissa was able to ask for some of it to take the underground. Her justification was that binding the affections of one whose talent was of interest to the Dark Lord could only benefit the family. Her parents assented and admired her self-sacrifice.

Severus had to navigate the Tube. The underground was new to him too, but he at least comprehended the route charts. Tower Hill was on both the District and the Circle lines, so a change at South Kensington was all that was necessary. The two of them actually stood in line to enter through the Middle and Byward Towers, and then Severus's illusions were trampled into the dust of convenience. Right at the rise where the Coldharbour gate had once been, he and Narcissa `accidentally' ran into Lucius.

Narcissa made the introductions, and Lucius remembered meeting before, but nothing could soften the sneer of superiority he wore at any encounter with a muggle or a half-blood.

"Right," Severus announced with a fierce decision. "I'll wait for you by Traitors' Gate."

"No. No. Lucius, you have to talk to him. Severus, you have to stay."

There, at the beginning, only Narcissa held them together, for Lucius and Severus would have squared off against each other like alpha gorillas in a hillside pack, posing and spitting in rage. There was a part of Lucius that assumed that every male, regardless of age, wanted and needed Narcissa, and it took until noon before he realized that Severus was not actually a rival.

"This is the first time we've been able to meet and just talk since last Christmas," Narcissa admitted sadly. "We run in the same crowd, we go to the same parties, but we can't talk because there's always someone to overhear. Father won't allow me to go out alone because, well..."

"He doesn't trust her. Or me. He's sure we'd do exactly what we're doing now. Meeting against his wishes."

"Why don't you use a spell so you can talk at the parties?" Severus asked.

"Silencing spells are more noticeable than conversation," Lucius replied. "They'd arouse suspicions at once."

"What if it doesn't create silence? Just a background hum for the listener, like the surrounding conversation?"

"I've never heard of a spell like that."

By the end of the week, Severus presented Narcissa and Lucius with the Muffliato spell as a Christmas gift.

"He creates new spells." Lucius was talking to an older man, the father of Severus's room mate Evan Rosier.

"Evan said he was clever with hexes and jinxes."

Lucius shook his head at the blindness and lack of imagination he was confronted with daily. "Have you ever created a spell?"

"I've never been the clever type."

"Idiot! Do you know anyone who's created their own spells? Have you a clue how rare that is? Do you know how much I'd pay if someone could teach me to do that? It's a gift." Lucius paused. "And he's never learned anything from the Dark Lord. It's all natural talent. I wonder if he can do things the Dark Lord..." Lucius didn't finish the sentence. He didn't trust Rosier that much.
