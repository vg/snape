\subsection{Chapter 5: Chapter 5 â€“ Waiting for Hogwarts}

\emph{\textbf{I Principio... - }}\textbf{Waiting for Hogwarts}

\emph{Tuesday, December 2, 1969 (the last quarter)}

At the beginning of December, Toby's hours at the mine were cut. He came home that night roaring drunk.

"Ge' yer 'ands off me woman!" he bellowed at Eileen as she tried to get him upstairs to bed. "Where's m' son? Russ! Ge' out here n' keep yer father company. Where's m' boy!"

Russ was outside in the cold area yard where a steady rain had already drenched him to the skin. The door was ajar, and he could hear everything.

"Come to bed, Toby. You're tired. You got to get some sleep..."

"Wha's a man to sleep for if he don't got a job t' go to in th' morning? Russ! Ge' out here!"

The silence mirrored Russ's own shock. His dad didn't have a job? There was nothing worse that could happen. He waited, scarcely breathing.

"Toby," Eileen whispered, "you're not redundant? Not now with winter coming on?"

"Good as... Take a man's hours away, take 'is pay. Where's m' boy?" There was another silence, then... "Whyn't y' witch 'em? 'Ere I'm saddled wi' a witch 'n a witch's brat, 'n she can't witch me up a decent job 'r decent pay. What good are ya, woman! Take a man's money 'n give 'im nothing!'

"Toby, come upstairs. It'll be better in the morning. It'll..."

"Ge' yer 'ands off me!" There was the sound of a fist hitting flesh, and a thump as someone fell against the wall.

Russ was through the kitchen and into the sitting room at once. Eileen was on the floor, but already starting to rise. Toby swayed near the foot of the stairs. "Mum!" Russ screamed and made to cross over to his mother, but Toby grabbed his arm.

"You b'n keepin' away from me, y' ungrateful brat! You 'n yer useless mam! I'll give you what for!"

His belt came down, buckle end this time, and Russ kicked and shrieked as it struck, his arm held in a viselike grip. Eileen moved in, and Toby swung at her; the buckle caught her ear and drew blood. Russ kicked and connected with a knee cap, making his dad turn and strike him backhand across the mouth. Eileen grabbed Toby's left arm, and the grip on Russ eased. He wriggled out of his dad's grasp, Toby lunged for him, stumbled on the threadbare carpet, and fell. He struggled for a moment to rise, but he was too drunk, and then he was asleep.

Eileen looked down at her husband sprawled on the floor. "Bloody mine," she hissed. "Bet the managers aren't going hungry. Here, Russ, help me get him on the sofa." Together they hauled Toby over and dragged him onto the sofa, then Eileen took Russ into the kitchen to check his mouth, back and legs. "He gave you a couple of good ones, then, didn't he?" she said as she dabbed at the spots where the buckle 'd broken the skin a little. "Stopped bleeding, though."

"Mum, your left ear's bleeding." Russ helped his mum wash off her ear and neck where there was a small trickle. A bruise was just starting on her jaw.

"I've half a mind to send you to Nana," Eileen said, "even if it means missing school. We're in for a rough stretch."

"Why don't we both go to Nana?" Russ asked. "She'd make him stay away."

Eileen shook her head. "Who'd take care of him?" she said quietly, glancing toward the sitting room. "Your dad ain't one that can live alone. He wouldn't last a week." She reached out a hand and touched a welt on Russ's shoulder. "He's not a bad man, Russ, just one that muddles through the best he can, but sometimes he can't even do that. It ain't easy working in a mine, the dark, the dust, the hard work, and then they take even that away. And he lies in bed of a night fretting and worrying and sick just thinking about the future. At least with a bit of gin in him he can sleep..."

"Can't you just use your wand? It'd be..."

"You don't. Use. Magic. Against. Muggles. Not ever. And if we go around breaking the rules about magic in a muggle community, they can keep you out of..." Eileen looked at Russ, then grasped his face between her hands, her own face fierce and determined. "You listen to me," she said. "You don't ever get in the middle of that ever again. I can handle your dad, but you got to stay out of it. We got a year and a half to make through, and then you're going to Hogwarts. You'll be safe in Hogwarts. And I'm not doing anything to give them a reason to keep you out. We can do magic out on the moors where no one can see us or identify us, but not in town. Promise?"

"Yes, Mum."

The following day, Russ went to school as tightly locked down as he had ever been in his life. His dark eyes were cold and empty, and no spark of feeling bubbled up through the latched doors. His teacher asked him how he came by the cut and bruise on the side of his mouth, and he looked her straight in the eyes, knowing she would never be able to read him, and answered, "Accident," in a cool, collected voice. The fact that her knowing smirk implied that she suspected a drunken, working-class father bothered him not at all. He cared nothing for her or for any of the other students. Today he didn't even care for Lily. That, too, was locked away.

That night, Russ sat up with his mum waiting for his dad to get home. When they heard his hobnailed working shoes staggering along the cobblestones, Eileen ordered Russ out of the house, not to come back until Toby was in bed. Still locked down, still cold and detached, Russ obeyed. He obeyed night after night for two weeks.

He couldn't bear to stay in the area yard in the back listening to the same scene played over and over again. When his dad came home, Russ went out onto the moors. He no longer got undressed for bed, but wore his clothes at all times, so that outside at night, with the collar of the pea coat turned up to protect his ears, he could still be warm in the winter cold. Sometimes it rained. Sometimes there was a light dusting of snow. Once the sky was clear and glittering with a million stars.

Term ended, and school let out for the Christmas break; Lily's family went to Hampshire for three weeks. Then, two days before Christmas, there was a cave-in in an old section of the mine they'd decided to reopen and try to work again. Toby came home that night crazed with grief and anger. Russ heard the lamp smash just as he was closing the kitchen door, and stayed, afraid now to leave his mother alone, trying to decipher from the sounds what was happening in the next room

"Toby, no! Put that down, we can't afford more if you..." The sound of a plate breaking against the wall. "Ge' off me, woman! Bloody murd'rin' swine e'ry one o' 'em!" A chair thrown across the room. Russ cowered by the door, trembling as his mum's pleas, his dad's roars, the crash of objects to the floor told of violence spiraling out of control.

Russ couldn't stand it any more. He eased the door open. His parents were yelling at each other, Eileen trying to restrain the furious Toby, whose back was turned to Russ. Russ took a deep breath and slipped past his dad up the stairs.

Toby saw the movement. "Get back here, you brat!" he yelled, and made a grab that missed. He started up the stairs after the boy.

"Toby!" Eileen shrieked. "Russ, get out of here! Toby!

Russ rushed into his room and out again, wand now in hand. In the face of his father's ferocious charge and his mother's cries to stop, he pointed the wand and said, loudly and clearly\emph{, "Stupefy!"} Red light spurted from the wand, Eileen screamed, and Toby crumpled there on the stairs and fell backwards, crashing down the steps to the floor and lying motionless.

"You've killed him!" Eileen screamed, dropping to her husband's side. "My wand! Get my wand now!"

Russ, horrified at what had happened, raced for the kitchen drawer where Eileen kept the wand and brought it to her, then crouched miserably in a corner as she began the low healing chants to repair the damage he had caused. Even as she worked, there was a bump and flutter against the window. Not wanting his mum interrupted, Russ rose and crossed to the window to open it and take the heavy official envelope from the owl. All around him the world was crumbling, and it was his fault. And still Eileen chanted, and still Russ waited.

When Toby was finally sleeping safely, Eileen rose and walked over to Russ, her face pale and furious. She held out her hand, and Russ gave her the letter. She opened it, glanced at the contents then, white with rage, handed it to Russ.

It was short and to the point. Two spells, one an attack spell and one a healing spell, had been performed with two different wands in a home with only one adult witch in an area where they might have been seen by muggles. They were reminded that wizards under the age of eleven were not allowed to use wands, and that continued violation of the Magical Secrecy Act and the Restriction on Underage Magic might result in the confiscation of the wands and the revocation of the privilege of attending Hogwarts School.

"Why didn't you leave like I told you?" Eileen said coldly. "A mate of his was killed today. He needed to blow off steam. He didn't touch me, just furniture. You used magic against a muggle. You dropped him on a staircase and near killed him. You brought the Ministry down on us and now they're talking about Hogwarts. Nothing is going to keep you out of Hogwarts. Especially not your own stupidity."

She seized his wrist and dragged him after her out onto the dark moor. There she stripped off the coat, pulled up the smock and with a murmured \emph{"Flagello,"} wielded her wand like a whip. When she was done, she wrapped her son in the coat and carried him back into the house.

Russ spent the next three days in bed while his mum tended the lash marks on his back. They stung like fury, but Eileen couldn't risk using magic with two counts already against them at the Ministry, so Russ had no recourse but to endure. It was then, with the constant prodding of pain, that he began to exploit, without even willing himself to do so, the inner recesses of his own mind.

The first thing he realized was that a total emotional lockdown made the pain easier to endure. The pain didn't go away, and it didn't lessen, but he didn't care about it as much. He could accept the pain as simply there, and was able to concentrate on other things in spite of it. Then he realized that, separated from any emotional reaction to what had happened, he was able to understand both the necessity for and the justice of what his mum had done. Russ had broken the rules.

One of the rules was that you never broke the rules of people who controlled what you wanted or needed. You had to figure out first what you needed, then what you wanted, and then you had to learn who, if anyone, controlled it. Their rules were the important rules. Russ had to get into Hogwarts. The Ministry controlled that. The Ministry's rules couldn't be broken, not by him and not by his mum. The Ministry controlled nothing that Nana needed or wanted. Their rules didn't affect her.

Another rule was that there were different levels for the concept of unfair. A lightweight fighting a featherweight was basically unfair because of the weight difference, but as Nel Tarleton proved, the odds could be evened out by applying other physical talents that reduced the advantage. Magic, on the other hand, was an irreducible advantage. A nonmagical person had no chance against a magical person, and there was no nonmagical talent that could even the odds. To use magic against a muggle was more intrinsically unfair than to use magic against a weaker wizard. The weaker wizard could compensate. The muggle couldn't.

Still another rule was that you never interfered with someone who'd decided that the goal was worth the pain. His mum had decided that protecting him and giving his dad a way to 'blow off steam' was worth the pain of an occasional black eye or bruised jaw. He'd tried to take that decision away from her, and thereby negated the freedom she needed to control her own life.

Russ was, in fact, beginning to learn that pain and disappointment are two of the most profound teachers in a person's life. If you never have to learn to deal with pain and disappointment, then you don't have the tools or the defenses to survive. Russ was a survivor. He would learn from his disappointment, and he would learn from his pain, and locking himself down was a way to do both.

In this fashion, Christmas came and went with no one in the Snape household even noticing. There was, in any case, no money for a tree, presents, or special foods. Just having enough food was a gift.

With the new year, Russ returned to school, his being locked down now the most natural of states for him. The first Friday of the new term was his tenth birthday, an event notable for its lack of celebration. The following day he went to the tree by the river to see Lily privately for the first time in a month.

\emph{Saturday, January 10, 1970 (halfway between the new moon and the first quarter)}

"What happened?" was the first thing Lily said when she arrived at the tree Saturday afternoon, all bundled up against the cold. There wasn't any snow, but the shallow places on the river had a thin crusting of ice.

"Nothing, why?" Russ replied.

"Severus Snape, you're lying to me. You've changed, gotten all... distant and turned off."

"I'm always distant and turned... off. There's no one at school for me to... turn on for. Except you, of course."

"How's your mum?"

"Okay, I guess."

"And your dad?"

Russ didn't answer. Instead he looked across to his side of the river, the side with no trees. "I suppose he's okay, too," he said after a moment.

"Do they fight?"

"They argue a lot." It wasn't really a lie, because he hadn't said no about the fighting, and they did argue.

"Don't take it to heart," said Lily and reached into her pocket. "I brought you something." It was a little square of gingerbread with icing on it. Lily also fished out a tiny, partially burnt candle. "I can't light it because I can't use matches, but you can pretend to blow it out. I know it's late." She stuck the candle into the icing and handed the gingerbread to Russ. "Happy birthday," she said.

Russ stared down at the little square that he knew would be sharp and sweet at the same time because he'd had gingerbread at his grandmother Gra's house, and occasional other sweets at home when times were good. He thought of them as something special, to be treasured, and wondered if Lily felt the same way. "Thanks," he said, and looked into her eyes.

This time he was expecting it, and it didn't frighten him as much. As he looked into the green eyes, the locks began to unlock and the latches to unlatch. The part of his brain that had been detached and clinical for so many weeks analyzed the phenomenon and wondered if this always happened between friends or if it was something about Lily in particular, and then he realized that the surfacing feelings were too many to cope with at once, and he glanced away. The latches clicked back into place.

He had, however, learned something else. It wasn't as clear and definite as seeing an attack spell in his mum's eyes when they practiced out on the moor - more of a vague, partly defined impression - but he knew, with certainty, that Lily would never willingly hurt him. "How did you... know?"

Lily giggled. "I'm not telling," she said. "My secret."

"I know yours is at the end of... January. What day is it?"

"Not telling that either. How do you know?"

"Miss Wade last year had a list of months and... birthdays, and our names in order, but I couldn't see the... dates. How can I say 'Happy Birthday' to you if I don't... know?" Russ looked at her again, and the fresh breeze of her gaze blew through the unlatched doors. He realized he could control this by looking up and down, maintaining a balance.

"You just wait 'til you know it's past, then you say 'Sorry I'm late, but happy birthday.' Just like I did. There. That's my secret." Lily was laughing now.

"You mean you really didn't know... yesterday was my birthday?" Russ wasn't laughing exactly, but his smile had a liberating feeling.

"Wow. I got really close, didn't I?"

The ground was too cold to sit on, so they stood next to the tree and shared the gingerbread. Lily told Russ all about Hampshire and her visit to the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth, and the two days she'd been in London. Russ couldn't tell her about his Christmas break, so he just said, "I was sick for a few days," and "Nothing much. The usual. Kind of boring, really."

Then Lily told Russ some silly jokes her cousin in Hampshire told her. Things like 'What does a five hundred pound mouse say? - Here kitty, kitty,' and 'Why aren't you ever hungry on the beach? - Because of the sand which is there.' Then she had to explain to him about 'sand which is' and 'sandwiches' because Russ wasn't too good at jokes, but he got the last one all by himself. 'Where does a five hundred pound gorilla sleep? - Anywhere he wants to.' By then both of them had reached a point where they'd giggle at anything.

After that, Lily had to go home. They said, 'see you in school' knowing they couldn't talk there, and they arranged to meet the following week, knowing it might not be possible, and then Russ went home, and as he crossed the river and made his way past the derelict mill, the doors began to close and latch again, and the locks made everything secure. He didn't make it happen, it just happened.

The feeling of openness and lightness of being was gone, and would not return until Russ was able to look again into the green eyes, but he didn't really mind. What he felt - or rather didn't feel - at that moment was quite normal to him. He was under no illusions about life. Most of it was muddling through, or dealing with hardship, or surviving storms. Every now and then, if you were lucky, there were some happy moments. Russ was lucky. Sometime in the next few weeks, maybe as soon as the very next Saturday, he'd have another happy moment. It was something to look forward to.

Winter melted into spring, and Toby got his hours back at the mine where a new shaft held some promise of steady work. Life at home calmed down, and once again father and son played cribbage of an evening after Russ was done with his homework. Eileen found a place in a town seven miles away that gave her needlework, piecework that she could bring home and embroider and return when she was done for decent pay, the little label 'hand embroidered' being something the company used to charge more from the tourists who bought the table linen they manufactured. Sometimes Eileen would take the things to Nana's house and embroider with magic. It went faster that way, and brought in more shillings.

As April opened with its new leaves and first shoots that would be flowers by May, and the world began to look fresh and green again, Russ once more turned his eyes to the heavens. April eleventh was the day he was waiting for. April eleventh would bring the reenactment of another important part of his life. The Americans were planning their third lunar expedition, and this time Russ and Lily were conspiring to see if they could find a way for him to finally watch it on television.

Russ hadn't seen the first moon walk, and no one had seen the second, but he had high hopes for the astronauts and lunar excursion module of Apollo 13.

The Saturday before, on the fourth of April, Russ went over the terminology with Lily: launch, splashdown, lunar orbit, liftoff, command module, reentry, and all the other useful facts she'd need to follow what was happening. Launch was from Cape Kennedy just after eight o'clock at night, and Russ planned to be out on the moors waiting for Lily's signal that all had gone well, that the rocket hadn't blown up. "Although," Russ assured her, "the Saturn rocket's never failed. It has a perfect record."

"I think it's great you like this space business so much."

"You're interested in it, too."

"Not as much as you," Lily said, "but when you talk about it, you forget to stammer."

"That sounds like you think I... stammer on purpose."

"You know I don't mean that!"

"Okay," said Russ, the stammering immediately forgotten again, "liftoff is on the eleventh. The lunar excursion starts the sixteenth and goes into the seventeenth, reentry and splashdown are on the twentieth. Now we have to find out when the BBC is broadcasting because they won't do it for the whole thirty-three hours they're on the moon."

The launch went as planned the evening of the eleventh, and Lily's flashlight beam told Russ that all was well. All continued well for the next two days, but Tuesday morning the rumors began to fly.

"There was this big explosion, and the whole spaceship was torn apart!"

"I heard the ship's like a big coffin and they're going to stay up there forever."

"A meteor hit it and all the air escaped into space!"

"It's going to fall into the sun!"

"Don't be an idiot! It isn't anywhere near the sun!"

That afternoon, the teachers dedicated themselves to rumor control and science lessons. Russ's teacher was loaded with details. She referred constantly to a piece of paper as she drew a diagram of the different parts of the 'spaceship,' the modules Russ already knew as the Odyssey and the Aquarius, and explained.

"There's been an explosion, but they don't know what caused it since they can't go back there to look. They've lost a lot of electrical power on board, and now they have to save the batteries to get back to earth. So they turned everything off in this big part of the ship, and moved into the little part where they use less electricity. When they get back close to earth, they'll turn everything on again."

That was all right, but then over the next two days the teacher was talking about carbon dioxide and temperature, and something called 'trajectory.' It was very clear that these brave men, these astronauts, could die at any time.

It was a living nightmare, and Russ found his heart and soul linked with the flight crew of Apollo 13. They were young. Only Lovell was older than Russ's dad, and Haise was younger than his mum. That was old in one sense, but still far too young to die. They had children Russ's age. Luckily the whole rest of the world was caught up in the drama, too, and for once Russ didn't have to scavenge for information. It was all around him.

As he learned of all the different ways to die, Russ died with the astronauts. First was losing the air, being suffocated in carbon dioxide, struggling just to breathe. Then there was cold, as your fingers lost their feeling and you kept on trying to work instruments with hands too numb to manipulate the controls. Then there was the fear of ricocheting off the atmosphere, to careen into empty space and slowly die of cold, thirst, and hunger. And all the while knowing that no one, no one could ever come help you. That in the end, you were alone.

Russ longed for the chance to go into space, to heroically save the astronauts of Apollo 13, and knew that he was as helpless, as impotent as everyone else. There was nothing he could do.

The Odyssey and Aquarius went around the moon, and then they sped back towards earth, and suddenly reentry wasn't April twentieth, it was April seventeenth. Right around seven o'clock in the evening. Russ left an emergency note in one of Lily's books, and they met by the tree Wednesday afternoon after school.

"It's tomorrow. It's tomorrow around seven o'clock. I have to know if they get back all right. The heat shield, you know. It might've been damaged."

Lily frowned. "Dad's got an interview with a company in Birmingham. I don't know if it's tomorrow or Friday. If he goes tomorrow, Mum'll go with him. Don't know about Tuney. Maybe you could sneak in. They may not be showing it, though."

"How could anybody not be showing the splashdown? How could people not care?"

"Okay. Be outside hiding in the garden at six thirty. If Mum and Dad are gone, I'll try to keep Tuney upstairs. She's not so interested in this 'space' stuff. She'll stay there if she's got school work to do. I'll see you tomorrow night."

It wasn't easy getting to Lily's house on the seventeenth. It was right around supper time, and if Russ was seen in that part of town in his poor clothes he'd be taken for a prowler or a thief. He started early and made his way cautiously from street to street in order to be hiding under a bush in Lily's yard ten minutes ahead of schedule.

At six thirty, Lily opened the kitchen door, and Russ slipped into the house.

"Shh," Lily said. "Mum and Dad are in Birmingham, but Tuney's listening to records upstairs." And indeed, Russ could hear "Gimme Shelter" from the upper part of the house as Lily led him into their sitting room where the television was already on and tuned to BBC1.

The Evans house was an intimidating place to be. Larger and filled with newer and more expensive things than Mrs. Hanson's home, it made Russ feel very dirty and uncouth. He was afraid to touch anything for fear of leaving finger marks, and when Lily invited him to sit down, he shook his head. He pretended that he preferred standing. In reality, he didn't want to touch the sofa.

"They're not broadcasting it," Russ said, for the normal Friday night show was on.

"They'll switch over soon," Lily replied. "They've already alerted us that as soon as the capsule is close enough, they'll pick up the transmission of the splashdown."

Sure enough, at about a quarter to seven, they started getting a picture from a big American ship in the Pacific Ocean. The BBC announcer was explaining that the spacecraft was about to begin its descent, and that there would be a radio blackout due to ionization of the hull. Normal blackout was about three minutes; this one would be longer because of the shallow angle of entry.

Blackout began, and Russ and Lily waited. Three minutes seemed an eternity, and while they were waiting the announcer explained that there was the possibility that the spacecraft would just burn up in the atmosphere because a heat shield may have been damaged, or the parachutes might not open and the capsule would be destroyed in its freefall crash into the ocean. It was terrible to listen to.

Three minutes was up, and nothing happened. The announcer explained again about the shallow angle. Thirty more seconds... still probably okay... thirty more... they were obviously worried now, and Russ began to shut down... another thirty seconds... and suddenly there was a crackle on the radio, and the astronauts were talking to Houston, and they were safely through the blackout... And Lily let out a whoop, and hugged Russ right there in front of the television.

"What are you doing down there?" Petunia called. "Why are you making so much noise?"

"It's just the television Tuney," Lily called back. "I'm watching that moon thing, and everybody's happy because it looks like they're going to make it home."

"Oh, that thing. Don't yell like that, please. I'm listening to something."

Lily put her finger to her lips, and she and Russ turned back to the television because it wasn't over yet. The spacecraft was still falling, and Russ wouldn't be satisfied until it was in the water and the astronauts climbing out.

It took nine minutes for the rest of the long plunge to earth. Russ and Lily heard that the parachutes had opened long before they could see the capsule, and then it came into view and hit the water, and they knew the worst was over. They couldn't see any more after that, because the ship was too far away from the capsule. A helicopter was on its way to them, and then the BBC interrupted its coverage to return to normal programming. It would be a while before the ship reached the astronauts, but they would keep their viewers informed.

That was it. Russ knew he couldn't stay until the recovery of the capsule. He had to leave Lily's house and go home. Lily had other ideas.

"Would you like a glass of milk and some gingerbread before you go?" she asked. "I ought to have asked you earlier, but we were too interested in the splashdown."

Russ was going to say no, then remembered how good Mrs. Hanson's milk tasted. "I don't want to be any trouble for you," he said.

"No trouble. We can eat in the kitchen."

"Who are you talking to?" Petunia shouted from upstairs.

"It's the television," Lily shouted back. She and Russ scurried into the kitchen, where Russ felt more comfortable about sitting on the chairs, and Lily got him some milk and a little plate of gingerbread. "That was scary," she said as she settled into her chair. "I thought for a few minutes they weren't going to make it. It seemed like such a long time."

"In a way, it probably wasn't as hard for the astronauts," Russ replied. "They knew they were still alive. It's us who didn't know what was happening that felt it was long."

"I don't think I could ever do what they did," Lily said. "I mean asking for a job where I knew I might die like that, all alone up in space with no one to help me."

"There are worse ways to die," said Russ. "At least they were able to keep working on it, keep trying to solve their problem, right up until the last possible moment. Even if they did die, they'd have been thinking of something else when it happened. It'd be a lot worse to be in some kind of accident, like a mine cave-in, where you're trapped for hours or days in the dark, and there's nothing you can do to keep your mind off dying. Or do you remember our first year in school when they found those bodies in Manchester?"

"Yes, I remember that."

"My dad says if that'd been a year or two earlier, they'd have been hanged. Imagine walking out to die and you have to stand there while everyone's watching you, and nobody's going to help you because they all want you dead. That'd be worse, too."

"Do you think about dying a lot? It's like when you talk about the astronauts. You're not stammering."

Russ shook his head. "Not a lot, but sometimes. My dad works in a mine, and there was a cave-in last December and one of his mates died. It messed him up for a while, and when I thought about it I could see..." Russ paused because of the look on Lily's face.

"Your dad works in a mine?" she said.

Russ looked down at his hands, at the dirt under the fingernails and around the cuticles, and thought of his dad's hands, grimy and calloused from working with the tools and the slate. He'd bet anything Lily's dad didn't work half as hard. "Yeah," was all he said.

"But if your mum's a witch, can't she do something?"

"Nah. I... told you. We can't make... anything that doesn't already... exist. And we can't do... magic where... muggles can see."

"What would they do to you if you did?" Lily picked up a piece of gingerbread and nibbled the edge, her head cocked to one side.

"They could keep me out of... Hogwarts, and there's other... things they could do."

"Like what?"

Petunia unwittingly came to the rescue. "Lily, you're talking to somebody down there. You're not supposed to have people in the house when Mum and Dad are away." They could hear her footsteps on the stairs.

Russ was up immediately and out the back door. He didn't run, though. He needed to be cautious getting back out to the moors, and besides, he wanted to hear what Lily and Petunia would say.

Petunia's voice got louder with the kitchen door no longer muffling it. "Who was here with you?"

"No one," Lily answered. "I was playing a game."

"How come there's two glasses of milk?"

"I poured one, then forgot I had it. Then I poured another. Don't worry, I'll finish both of them."

"I don't believe you!"

"I don't care if you believe me or not. You're not my mother."

"It's that boy, isn't it? You had that strange Snape boy over didn't you?"

Lily laughed. "That's silly. How would he get here? Everybody'd chase him off. I'm going to tell Mum and Dad you're imagining stuff. Besides, you're just trying to scare me so you can bring your boyfriend over."

Twelve-year-old Petunia was incensed. "I don't have any stupid boyfriend!'

"Sue Hodges said her sister Mary said you were sweet on Brian Philips."

"That stupid git? I'd rather be sweet on a ferret!"

"Tuney lo-oves Brian... Tuney lo-oves Brian..."

Satisfied that Lily had the situation well under control, Russ ducked away from the bushes around the house and made his way stealthily to the moors and thence back home. It was still early enough that his parents hadn't been the slightest bit concerned as to his whereabouts.

"Mum," Russ asked later that evening, "what do they do to wizards who break the rules?"

"They have a prison, Mr. Nosey Parker, just for rule-breakers. It's called Azkaban."

"Is that a bad place?" Russ asked.

"Oh, very bad. It's guarded by dementors who'll steal all your happy thoughts and leave you miserable for the rest of your life." Eileen was putting away the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen, ready for the next morning.

"What do they look like?"

"Like nasty corpses in rotten grave cloths and when they kiss you, they suck out your soul." Eileen made a sudden lunge at Russ, who squealed in mock terror and dove out of her grasp.

"If I did something bad, would they send me to Azkaban?" Russ continued from a more defensive position.

"Why? What did you do?" Eileen regarded her son shrewdly.

"Nothing."

"Then they won't send you there."

"But if I did something bad?"

"They don't send children to Azkaban. If you did something really bad, they'd send me to Azkaban, and you and your father'd have to muddle through. Come to think of it, I could use a holiday. What're you planning?"

"Mum!"

"I mean it. I'd get there, and when they tried to suck out my soul I'd tell them all about my demon of a son who'd drive a saint to perdition and get them all feeling so sorry for me..."

"Mum!"

Eileen stopped, and she seemed to see something in Russ's face because she crouched down to talk to him. "Don't you ever forget," she said, "you're a good boy. There's nothing you could do that'd make anyone want to put you into Azkaban. You're a good boy."

"I've done wand magic."

"They don't put you into Azkaban for that."

The next time Russ saw Lily was in May under the tree by the river. That was when he told her about the owl from the Ministry and the warning message, though he didn't go into detail about why he'd cast a spell, or what his dad'd been like, or how his mum'd reacted. Just that he'd done magic and gotten a warning. And he told her about Azkaban and the dementors.

"They sound really scary," Lily said.

"They're supposed to be scary. It wouldn't do any good to have a prison people weren't scared of."

"I guess not."

"Magic's serious business," Russ said solemnly. "It's not a game. You've got to follow the rules."

Of course, there are more serious things in the world than just magic.

\emph{Monday, June 1, 1970 (three days before the new moon)}

School was winding down toward the summer break. On the first of June, Toby came home early from the pub, more sober than usual. Even more surprising, he brought a copy of the \emph{Manchester Guardian}. It was a rare thing for him to buy a newspaper, but one glance at the front page told Russ and Eileen why.

"Forty thousand people," Toby told them, awe mixed with sorrow in his voice. "Forty thousand. That's a whole town buried under the earth. Makes a mine cave-in look like nothing. A miner - he knows what might happen every time he goes down a shaft, but them? Who'd think the earth could move so 's t' make a whole mountain come down on ya? Where's Peru, boy?"

Russ hesitated a moment, then blurted out, "South America." Geography was something Miss Wade had stressed.

"Smart kid. They do well by ya in that school. They speak English there?"

"No, Spanish."

"Don't matter none. People's people. Ain't nothing worse 'n being buried before y're dead."

The \emph{Guardian} was left to Russ, who pored over every word in every paragraph. The next day he uncharacteristically slipped a note into Lily's hand. \emph{Ask about the Peru earthquake} it said. Lily obliged, and the class got a nice lesson about plate tectonics and fault lines.

On June 18, general elections were held and Labor was voted out. Toby hadn't been completely happy with a Labor Government that tried to limit workers' rights, but he was less than happy with a Conservative government that didn't bother about those rights at all. Workers in far off places like Wales were talking of strikes, and late nights at the pub became common again. Russ mastered sleeping with one ear tuned to the cobblestones, ready to slip out of the house at a moment's notice.

Ten days later, the school year ended. Lily went with her family to the Lake District and Scotland, and wasn't due back until August. For the first time in his life, Russ found himself with nothing new to do and no one to do it with. He was frustrated and bored, and old enough for the boredom and frustration to find expression in mischievous and potentially destructive activities. He prowled through his house, his neighborhood, and the town looking for an outlet for his nervous energy. He found the outlet in his great-grandfather's books.

The study of spells, charms, hexes, jinxes, and curses was no longer a matter of childish curiosity. That summer it became serious business. Russ 'borrowed' his mother's wand, went far out on the moors where the rules didn't apply, and practiced gestures and incantations and a new language. Wensley's ships had put into Piraeus often enough for him to invest in a tiny Greek dictionary and phrase book, and once Russ figured out the strange letters, it was a treasure trove of words, though he was aware that it wasn't the 'magic language' that Nana used. He had to experiment with pronunciation, but he was patient and determined.

The first spell Russ invented was one that made a pebble jump a few inches into the air. He'd been concentrating on it all afternoon, and was so surprised when it happened that he jumped backward himself and fell down. He practiced saying \emph{"Pido!"} to a number of small things and returned home with a sense of great accomplishment. This was no vague, childish play, but a deliberate, focused spell. He assumed all wizards invented such things. He had yet to learn what a rare talent it was.

Later in the month, having more or less mastered the Pido spell and remembering the events of early June, Russ checked his Greek dictionary for the word for earthquake. It was \emph{Seismos.} He tried making a spell with the word, but with little success. Not daunted, he continued trying.

\emph{Saturday, August 8, 1970 (two days before the first quarter)}

Lily returned in August, and it was sunny and hot the second Saturday, when Russ and Lily were able to meet under their tree. The bright sun made the river sparkle, and you could almost forget how dirty it was. Russ even removed the ever present pea coat, now comfortable enough with Lily that he was confident she wouldn't laugh at his clothes. There was, however, a new barrier between them.

Russ found himself unable to look Lily in the eyes. It wasn't that he was afraid she could read him - he knew by now she couldn't - but that the feeling of being so open when he now had so much to conceal made him nervous. What if he couldn't close down again before he went home to his mum? What if his mum found out he was using her wand and doing illegal magic, even if it was in a place where the rules were different? Russ couldn't risk it. He spent a lot of the conversation looking at the river. They were talking about Hogwarts.

"...then after you get the school letter, you can get a wand."

"I thought you already had a wand."

"Mum took it away from me. Besides, it wasn't really mine. It was my grandfather's." Russ thought about the feel of the wand in his fingers. His mother's borrowed wand didn't feel the same, and he knew he could do better magic with his grandfather's old one. That wand really was his - he could tell. He didn't say this to Lily, though. "They'll start teaching us real magic at Hogwarts. Then the rules get stricter, like I told you, and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school - you get letters."

Lily looked disbelieving. "But I have done magic outside school!" she insisted.

"We're all right. We haven't technically got wands yet. They let you off when you're a kid and you can't help it." Russ wasn't as sure what happened when you were a kid and knew enough magic so that you could help it, but not going to Hogwarts was involved. "But once you're eleven," he continued, "and they start training you, then you've got to go careful."

A random stick became a play wand in Lily's hand. "It is real, isn't?" The note of disbelief was softer now. This was something she wanted to be real. "It's not a joke? Petunia says you're lying to me. Petunia says there isn't a Hogwarts. It is real, isn't it?"

"It's real for us. Not for her. But we'll get the letter, you and me."

"Really?"

"Definitely."

"And will it really come by owl?"

"Normally. But you're muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents."

"Does it make a difference, being muggle-born?"

Russ found himself remembering the whispered conversations between his mum and Nana, the ones he wasn't supposed to have heard - A little half-blood boy like him... They'd eat him alive - and he knew not everything was perfect at Hogwarts. He looked at Lily then, her burnished red hair, the eager expression he knew so well, and couldn't bear the thought that his only friend might be afraid to go to Hogwarts, might refuse to go to Hogwarts. "No," he said. "It doesn't make any difference."

Their eyes met, the doors blew open and, as Lily rolled onto her back to stare up at the leaves, Russ watched inside his head where the selfish truth about himself was bubbling up through the open doors.

\emph{I'm afraid of Hogwarts. The stars say I'm to be sorted into Slytherin where they eat half-blood boys like me alive, and Mum's so worried she's teaching me how to fight. I don't know if I'll ever have a friend there. I've never met any other wizards, and the only witches I know are Mum, Nana, and Lily. What if they don't like me? But if Lily's there, I'll have a friend, and it'll be all right. She has to go. She has to be there. I need her to be there...} Then the doors slowly closed again for the green eyes were looking elsewhere.

"How are things at your house?" Lily asked, and Russ lied his little lie, downplaying the strife because he was ashamed of his dad, picking and pulling at the grass around him to keep from looking back at Lily's eyes, not wanting to see more of the truth.

"But it won't be that long and I'll be gone," he finished, hoping his mother was right, and it would be better at Hogwarts.

For some reason Lily wanted to talk more than usual, maybe because they hadn't seen each other in six weeks, and she changed the subject to Azkaban and the dementors. It was better than talking about his family, so Russ would have liked the conversation to continue, but at that moment he heard a rustle of leaves and grass much louder than any lizard or mouse could make, and Lily was scrambling to her feet crying, "Tuney!"

Their secret meeting place was no longer a secret.

Russ was on his feet at once, angry that Petunia would consider acceptable for her an action she'd condemned in him only a year earlier. "Who's spying now? What d' you want?" he demanded.

Instead of responding to the challenge, Petunia attacked on a personal level. She leveled a finger at Russ. "What is that you're wearing, anyway? Your mum's blouse?"

It was a low blow and, as fury blazed in him, Russ heard the snap of a breaking tree branch, Lily's warning cry, and then Petunia was pushed backwards when the falling branch struck her shoulder. She turned and ran from them, sobbing.

Lily's call of "Tuney!" had no effect. She spun to confront Russ, anger mounting in her as well. "Did you make that happen?"

He hadn't. He couldn't have. He hadn't noticed the branch until it fell. "No," Russ answered, and was distressed that Lily'd even asked the question.

Lily was already starting after Petunia. "You did! You did! You hurt her!" she flung at him, as she moved away.

"No - no I didn't!" but the protest was useless. Lily glared at him and was gone, leaving Russ staring forlornly at the branch on the ground where Petunia had been standing.

\emph{Did I do that? I didn't think about doing it. It just happened... }Yet Russ understood that somehow he had done it, had used the branch as a weapon against Petunia because Petunia was attacking something that lay at the core of his being, something that he couldn't give up. Now, because of it, he was losing Lily's friendship anyway, because of something bad that he'd done.

\emph{I lost control. I did childish, wandless magic because I lost control. Why did I lose control? I lost control because I wasn't shut down tightly enough. When you don't shut down, you lose control, and then people don't want to be around you. Like Lily doesn't want to be around me now. If I don't shut down tight enough, I'll lose control, and then Lily won't be my friend any more.}

Quietly, consciously, deliberately, Russ examined the latches and locks of his mind. They were dangerously loose and open. He closed them. And having closed them, he resolved to monitor them closely to ensure they remained closed. He couldn't afford more mistakes like the one he'd just made.

Russ walked home firm in his new resolve. The following weekend he went to the thicket of trees by the river, but Lily didn't come. He didn't see her again until school started in September - their last year of school before Hogwarts. By then, Russ had been practicing being shut down so well that he no longer had to think about it all the time. He'd also spent more time working on magic and, in his loneliness and isolation, had created spells that would make flowers droop and wilt, little patches of ground dry up and become hard, and small insects like ants grow confused and lose their way.

The first Saturday in September was the fifth, and Lily came to the river. Russ watched the path behind her, but saw no sign of Petunia. "Don't worry," Lily said. "She won't be coming any more. You were very mean to her."

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't even know it was me doing it."

"Well, you shouldn't do it any more. I couldn't be friends with someone I thought was mean."

"I won't do it any more. I've been practicing not getting angry."

"That's good. Because you did hurt Petunia, you know. She had a bruise on her shoulder."

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. It won't happen again."

"That's all right, then," said Lily, and they sat under the tree and talked. Russ was very careful not to look into her eyes so that he wouldn't lose control. It was good to have everything in his world back to normal.

Things were better with Toby as well. With full time work, and the extra Eileen brought in, he managed to save a little money, and on October 17, instead of staying home to rest after a hard week at the mine, Toby left for the morning and returned in the early afternoon at the wheel of a battered old black car that chugged and backfired as he drove it along the cobblestones to the house. Since theirs was the last home in Spinner's End, Toby parked the car beside the house.

There was a dog-eared, torn manual with missing pages, some tools, and a kit for patching the inner tubes of the tires. Together, with Eileen watching, Toby and Russ pored over the manual. Toby had considerable experience with the trucks and other machines at the mine, and soon father and son had the hood up and were tinkering with the engine, trying to improve the car's performance. They succeeded well enough that that evening they went for a short drive, and Russ got to feel the wind whipping at his hair through the open windows and the thrill of speeding along at thirty miles per hour.

Fall dissolved into winter, and then into a new year, and soon it was Russ's eleventh birthday.

\emph{Saturday, January 9, 1971 (two days before the full moon)}

For his eleventh birthday, Russ had an actual party. Both his grandmothers came, and he had not only cake, but three presents. The table in the sitting room was covered in a lace cloth supplied by Gra, and flowers from Nana's garden added color and a festival feeling.

The reason for the party was, of course, that if all went well, this was the last time he'd be home on his birthday for the next seven years. Toby wasn't entirely comfortable with the idea of his son attending a wizards' school, but the women dealt with it by reminding him of the major advantages - more time alone with Eileen, one less mouth to feed, and a son who, at the age of seventeen, would be able to keep the car properly tuned with a wave of his wand.

Gra, a lover of all kinds of puzzles, gave Russ a book of logic problems and a book of Sherlock Holmes stories. Nana's witching fees were mostly in kind, but she'd saved coin and bought him his first little cauldron and starting potions kit from a wizarding shop in Liverpool that carried school supplies.

Russ's mum and dad gave him a wonderful gift - trousers, shirt, shoes and a sweater that were only a little bit large, and actually came close to reasonably fitting. He tried them on to show how they looked and was quite the proper, respectable, working class boy. Then he changed back into his normal clothes so that the new ones wouldn't get dirty. They were for his trip to London at the end of August.

"Have you heard there's a new headmaster?" Nana asked after Russ blew out his candles, the cake was sliced, and Mum'd handed out the cups of tea.

"No. You mean old Dippet finally retired? It's about time. When I was there, the deputy headmaster already did most of the work anyway. We thought Dippet spent most of his time asleep." Eileen smiled to herself at the memory.

"Who was the deputy headmaster?"

"One of the Transfiguration teachers - Dumbledore." Eileen handed a slice of cake to Gra, who knew nothing of Hogwarts and wisely kept silent.

"He's the one who's just been made headmaster. Is he any good?" Nana asked.

"He's a shrewd one, that's for certain. Who'd take over as head of Gryffindor if Dumbledore's the headmaster?"

"Did you know a professor named Minerva McGonagall?"

Eileen shook her head. "She must have come after I left in June of fifty-two. I don't recall anyone named McGonagall."

"She's the new deputy as well, so Gryffindor remains firmly in charge. You said they always got the plums, didn't you?"

"It seems like my whole time there, the Head Boy and Head Girl were from Gryffindor house." Eileen turned to Russ, who was playing cribbage with his dad. "The discipline and order in the houses is maintained by the prefects of each house. You have to obey them." She turned back to the other women. "They all, regardless of their houses, are supervised by the Head Boy and Girl, who report to the deputy headmaster. So being Head Boy is a pretty powerful job. They always gave it to someone from Gryffindor because that was Dippet's old house and Dumbledore's, too."

"Sounds like Gryffindor has a lock on the power," said Nana, pouring herself another cup of tea.

"It didn't bother us too much, but the students in Slytherin were ambitious, and they resented being shut out." Eileen smiled across the table at her son. "Slytherin students are clever, and they all think Gryffindor students are strong, but brainless."

"My boy's clever," said Toby, not really paying much attention to the conversation. "He'll go with the clever ones. Y' don't need brawn to get along in the world, you need brains."

Late in the afternoon, they all got into Toby's car, Russ sandwiched in the back between his two grandmothers. First they took Nana to her neat little cottage in the country, then they drove to Gra's village where Toby helped his mother into the house, Gra having a little trouble walking. Then Toby gave Russ a treat by driving around for a while. Since they were on summer time all year, the sun didn't set until a quarter past five, so they got home just as it was getting dark.

It'd been a really nice birthday.

The next day was Sunday, and Russ wandered up to the little thicket of trees where he sometimes met Lily. There he found a piece of paper wedged between two branches. He unfolded it and read: \emph{I came at 2:00 and you weren't here. It was cold but I waited for an hour. What happened? I thought you'd always come Sat. afternoon. Where were you?}

The idea of Lily waiting in the cold for him was terrible. Russ wasn't sure what to do. He'd have to find some way to apologize because he didn't want to lose Lily's friendship due to his own thoughtlessness.

The end of January brought both Lily's birthday on the last Saturday of the month, and the launch of Apollo 14 the following evening. Russ didn't have any money for a present, so he walked the eight miles to Nana's cottage after school on the twenty-ninth and returned long after dark with a little bottle of potion that could revive any drooping flower, plus the instructions for making more. It was fairly simple, and the beauty of potions was that they required no wand magic, so he could brew them without fear of the Ministry.

Apollo 14 returned safely from its mission and splashed down late in the evening of the second Tuesday in February. Lily's parents, amused by her interest in the American space program, let her stay up long enough to get the news that the capsule and astronauts were safe. She beamed her flashlight out towards the moors, so that Russ could sneak back home to his warm bed and a peaceful night.

The very next day, every bank in Britain closed at three-thirty, not to reopen until the following Monday. The era of tuppences and sixpences was over. England had gone decimal, and suddenly everyone was talking about 'pee,' so what used to cost half a crown was now twelve and a half 'pee.' It didn't affect Russ much since he never had any money, but everyone else was confused for a while.

Then in April, Russ became interested in the Russians. The Americans were going to the moon, but the Russians had a space station orbiting the earth, the Salyut 1. The first crew sent up to enter the station had to return to earth because the docking mechanism wouldn't work, but the second crew made it and spent almost all of June working on experiments in space. Russ and Lily sat for their eleven-plus exams, but Russ's thoughts were more with the cosmonauts than on the test. The test didn't mean anything anyway. He wasn't going to one of those schools.

June 30 brought the first tragedy. The three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 died during their return to earth. A faulty valve allowed their air to escape, and the cosmonauts were asphyxiated within minutes. Russ had nightmares for a week, waking up struggling for breath as if something heavy was sitting on his chest.

And then, in the last week of July, the Hogwarts letters came.

Russ got his letter by owl, a majestic brown bird, and treasured the stiff parchment message with its green ink that told him what to bring. Eileen immediately pulled out her old robes and books, and began altering the first to fit Russ and sorting through the second for the ones he would need. The books were old, secondhand even when Eileen had them, but she and Russ agreed he could make notes in the margins of any material that was new since they were published.

Nana sent Nelson with a letter asking if she could pick up anything at the shop in Liverpool, and soon, with his birthday cauldron and his grandfather's wand, Russ had everything he needed. On Saturday the thirty-first, he met Lily under their trees on the river.

"It's so exciting!" Lily squealed, hugging Russ when she saw him. "It was just like you said, everything the way you said it. This woman came to the door, the deputy headmistress, and talked for the longest time with Mum and Dad, and did magic for them right there in the house! You should have seen Petunia's face. She's been teasing me about this for the longest time, and now she has to eat her words because it's all true!"

"What did your mum and dad say?"

"I think they were really shocked, but also relieved. I mean, they've been worried about me and the things I can do, and I think they were happy to find out I wasn't crazy. Petunia's gone all sour. I think she's jealous."

"Let her be jealous. It serves her right for being nasty."

"Don't be mean. Anyway, we're going to London next week because there's this secret place just for witches where we can buy all the things I need for school. Are you going there?"

"Don't have to. I've had all my school things for ages." Russ didn't think it was necessary to tell Lily that they'd been his mother's things.

"Have you ever been to London?"

Russ shook his head. The whole business about going to London to take the Hogwarts train was causing problems in his family. There was no train from Colne that would get them to King's Cross station in time to catch the express, so he and his mother would have to go the day before, but there was no money for lodgings. His mum and dad had been arguing about it since the letter came.

There was something else important to ask Lily. "Are you going to be back from London by next Saturday?"

"Sure. I even have the house to myself all evening. Mum and Dad are taking Petunia out to dinner and a movie in Colne. Sort of to give her some attention since I'm getting so much. Why?"

"There's another splashdown..."

"Again?"

"Apollo 15. Coming back from the moon. Please Lily. What if they die like the Russians? I have to know."

The landing was scheduled for just before ten o'clock in the evening on August seventh. Lily suggested that Russ come for supper so that she could play hostess, but he didn't want his parents to wonder where he was. She settled for dessert and tea. He agreed to arrive around nine, and would leave well before her parents and Petunia got back.

Russ's arrival went according to plan, and he got to Lily's house just as the sun was setting, not having been seen by anyone. In honor of the occasion, he was wearing the new clothes he would take with him to Hogwarts. He felt very proper and dressed up. She let him into the kitchen where she had cake and tea ready, and for fifteen minutes they ate and talked about Hogwarts.

"Would you like to see my house?" Lily asked suddenly. "You hardly got to see anything the last time you were here."

"Sure," Russ replied, having not only the vague impression that refusing would be impolite, but also curiosity about the place where Lily lived. He wasn't as intimidated as he'd been the first time, since this time he had an idea what to expect.

The downstairs had a dining room as well as a living room. The upstairs had a bath and three bedrooms. Russ was immensely impressed that Lily didn't have to share her bedroom with Petunia, though Lily admitted that if they had overnight guests, she did.

Lily's room was robin's egg blue and white. "I wanted paisley," she told Russ proudly, "but Mum wouldn't hear of it." Petunia preferred yellow. It surprised Russ that Petunia's room was more frilly than Lily's. If he'd had to guess, he would have thought the other way around. Each girl had a bed, a desk and chair, a small bookcase and...

"What's that?" Russ asked, pointing to Petunia's desk where a yellow envelope with green writing lay.

"I don't know," said Lily.

"It's a letter from Hogwarts."

"Really? Petunia didn't mention it."

"That's not possible," Russ said, walking to the desk and staring at the envelope. "Muggles don't get Hogwarts letters."

"Maybe it isn't really from Hogwarts," Lily said, and picked the envelope up. It was the same parchment and the same green ink. "I wonder what it says. You don't think Petunia's been accepted to Hogwarts, too, do you?"

"Has she ever shown any magic ability?"

"I never saw any."

"Then she can't go."

Curiosity got the better of Lily, and she opened the envelope. After looking at the letter for a moment, she handed it to Russ. It was from Headmaster Dumbledore, gently explaining that unfortunately only persons with magical talent could attend Hogwarts. He understood Petunia's desire to learn magic with her sister, but it was not possible.

"She wrote to the school," Russ said in surprise. "How could she do that? I always thought muggles couldn't write to them, like there's someone in the postal service that stops the letters."

"Maybe it happened during the postal strike. That lasted forever."

Russ shook his head. "That ended in March. She must've writ to him after you got your letter last week."

"Poor Petunia," Lily sighed. "I guess she is jealous after all. She was on about you and me being freaks, but that could have been after she got the answer to her letter."

"Well let her be jealous. I don't care. I don't want her at Hogwarts. She's never been nice to me."

"Don't be mean, Severus."

"Mean is as mean does. I'm glad she won't be going."

At that moment, they both remembered the Apollo 15 capsule hurtling toward earth, and ran to warm up the television. Because of the recent Russian tragedy, the BBC picked up the image just before a quarter to the hour. Russ saw what was wrong at the same time the announcer did.

"There's only two parachutes open! What happened to the third one?"

All thought of Petunia's letter vanished as, heart in his throat, Russ watched the Endeavour plunge to earth. As it turned out, the third parachute was there just as a precaution, and the capsule was perfectly capable of landing in the ocean with two. Less than a minute after being terrified half out of his mind for the astronauts, Russ was hugging Lily madly in the knowledge that they were safe. Then he slipped out of her house and made his way home.

On August 30, both Nana and Gra came to stay the night in order to see Russ off at the train station in Colne. He was taking a footlocker with his books and a few extra things like changes of underwear, and Gra brought an old, somewhat battered Gladstone bag that had belonged to Wensley Snape in the days when he went to sea. The bag was for carrying Russ's robes and hat so he could change on the train.

It was a Monday night. Toby'd taken the following morning off to drive all of them, Eileen and Russ to the station at Colne, and then Nana and Gra to their homes. He'd be by himself one night, but there was a train Eileen could catch from Euston Station after leaving Russ on the platform at King's Cross that would get her home the evening of the second day, September first. Russ had the feeling his dad was looking forward to that night.

Lily had already left. She, her parents, and Petunia had spent the weekend in London. Russ wouldn't see her until they got to King's Cross Station, and he wouldn't be able to talk to her until the train was on its way to Scotland. After that, though, they no longer had to worry about their parents or Petunia.

That evening, Russ had a thorough wash at the sink upstairs. It was years now since he'd stood in the wash tub in the kitchen, but he still hated the whole process. Nonetheless, tonight he wanted to be especially clean for the trip to London in his new clothes. The worst part was his hair, which he couldn't wash upstairs so as not to get hairs in the drain. No, washing his hair had to be done outside in the area yard, stripped to the waist, while his mother poured water over his head in full view of the neighbors. It was humiliating, but Russ endured it. It was the last time for ten months. For Hogwarts, he'd endure anything.

"What say y' give us a game, eh boy?" Toby said after dinner, and they pulled out the cribbage board and the cards.

"You might let the child visit with us," said Nana primly. "We're the ones who don't see him every day."

"That's why you won't miss him so much as I will," Toby retorted. "'Sides, he can talk while he plays. He ain't no dummy, my son."

Despite the barbs, the evening was good humored and pleasant, and Russ even got the feeling his father and his grandmother enjoyed a bit of sparring. The grandmothers were sharing his room, and Russ spent the night on the old sofa downstairs.

They were up early the next morning to a hearty breakfast and the double checking of all Russ's things. The women fussed over how neat he looked in his new togs, while Toby went out for the twentieth time to run a cloth over the car to be sure it looked nice. The footlocker was loaded into the trunk of the car, then, at last, they were off to Colne.

"Now you remember," Toby said at the train station for the fifth time since he parked the car, "you don't let no one put nothing over. They try, and you give 'em what for."

"Sure, Dad."

They stood in an embarrassed little group on the platform until the train pulled up, and then there were hugs from the grandmothers while Toby watched. Last of them all, he faced his son and solemnly shook hands. "You remember who you are, Russ. Them college puddings can't never put nothing over on a lanky. You don't never forget that."

Eileen and Russ boarded the train and found seats in the nearly empty second class car. Russ had been on trains three times before in his life, once to Blackpool and twice to Manchester, and he knew the whole routine. They had sandwiches for the trip, which would be a long one since the train made every stop on the route. Longer from Lancashire to London than from London to northern Scotland, since the Hogwarts train was an express, Eileen explained.

The train was moving, and they were waving goodbye, and the adventure was truly started.

Eileen spent the trip reviewing with Russ all the things he needed to remember, about guarding his thoughts, about dueling and defending himself, about keeping his things secure, and about hiding from the authorities the fact that he'd been practicing magic, real magic, for some time, in defiance of the law. Keeping secrets wasn't a problem for Russ. He'd been keeping secrets for years.

From Euston station, they went to King's Cross where they checked almost everything they were carrying. Eileen had a special hotel in mind, one she'd stayed in as a student, and they shouldn't have luggage when they showed up there. "There," she said as they left the station. "Across the road." She was pointing to a church, a white church with a classic Georgian portico. "We should be in time for evensong. Then we have to be careful, but if we are it'll be a peaceful night."

Together mother and son crossed Euston Road and entered St. Pancras church.
