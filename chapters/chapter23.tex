\subsection{Chapter 23: Chapter 23 â€“ The End of All Things}

\textbf{Severus Snape: The Middle Years - The End of All Things}

\emph{Halloween, Saturday, October 31, 1981 (four days after the new moon)}

Breakfast was normal. Since it was Saturday, both teachers and students filtered into the Great Hall whenever it pleased them to be up and about. Dumbledore came in at about seven-thirty and sat briefly next to Severus, their conversation low so that no one else could hear.

"Any change from last night?"

"No, sir. I don't feel anything at all. No pain, no itching, all perfectly normal."

"Perhaps he sent out a general call, then remembered you had to stay here and canceled your summons. I have already notified some of my contacts to be on the alert for increased Death Eater activity. I shall also contact the Minister, who will want to know how I know, but I have no intention of telling him. It is possible that Moriarty is planning something big to `celebrate' Halloween."

"What about... you know?"

"I do not want to attract any attention by activity around the area where they live. Sirius Black is planning to join them tonight for a small holiday celebration. I have been attempting to locate him to ask him to go earlier. Since Moriarty will not be able to find Lily, he may attack someone close to her. I shall send someone to check on Lily's sister's family to be sure they are not targeted for anything." Dumbledore rose to leave. "And do not be overly concerned, Severus. So far your experience of last night is the only indication I have received that anything unusual is going on."

Severus watched as Dumbledore made his way out of the hall, stopping for a moment to speak to Professor McGonagall, who had just walked in. She immediately left the Hall with him.

More people came in to breakfast, and then the owls began to arrive. This was quite normal except that every child of a Death Eater in Slytherin got an owl, and they each appeared upset and nervous as they read their separate letters. Several of them moved to the end of the table to confer privately.

As Severus was leaving the Hall, one of them, Julius Prendergast's daughter Anna, came over to him. "Professor," she asked, "has something happened? I got a note from my mother about something strange last night, and everyone's waiting, but no one knows what's happened."

"I'm as much in the dark as everyone else," Severus told her. "Don't worry. We'll find out soon."

Severus advised Dumbledore about the messages to the students. None of the parents had said what exactly had caused their concern, not wanting to commit that information to writing, but he and Dumbledore reasoned that it was probably the same as for Severus, the sudden flaring and receding of pain in the mark on their arms.

As the day wore on, though, it began to look more and more like a false alarm. No Death Eater activity was reported. No disasters occurred. Severus still wanted Dumbledore to contact the Potters directly, but Dumbledore managed to calm him down.

"If Moriarty is planning something, he will be watching me especially to try to find out where they are. Owls can be tracked. Magic can be detected. Hagrid stands out like a signpost. Sirius will be arriving at their house in a couple of hours. If anything is wrong, he will send me a message."

The wizard festival of Samhain was probably Hogwarts' greatest feast, with the possible exceptions of the beginning and ending of the school year. That evening the Great Hall was festooned with skeletons and the representations of ghosts (as well as the real articles) for this commemoration of the mingling of the living with the dead at the witches' New Year. The feast was well under way when there was a sudden disturbance at the entrance to the Great Hall, and Dedalus Diggle and Doris Crockford pushed their way into the festival.

"Albus!" Dedalus yelled above the din of student voices, "Albus, we have great news!" The hall became silent as staff and students nudged each other and turned to look at the emissary. "Albus! We have great news! He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has been defeated! The Dark Lord is dead!"

Dumbledore rose majestically in the center of the staff table. "Dedalus!" he called in the silence. "This is good news indeed. Are you sure?

"There is no doubt! He has been defeated! He is dead!"

In a fraction of a second of uncertainty, Dumbledore glanced to his right. There, at the end of the table, stood young Professor Snape. And there was on his face a look of radiant joy such as Dumbledore had never expected to see. \emph{All is indeed well. He is free.} "You must join us, Dedalus, Doris! Our feast has begun, but you have brought us even more to celebrate."

"Alas, Albus, there is ill news with the good. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is dead, but at the cost of James and Lily Potter. He reached them first, but as they died, so did he."

There was then a moment of sorrowful silence, but the release of exuberance that accompanied the news that the wizarding world was no longer at war could not be contained. Hats flew into the air, and students and staff turned to each other with embraces and congratulations.

Joy turned to dust.

Severus came to his feet with everyone else in the Hall, relief beyond measure swelling in him at Dedalus's news, knowing that the Dark Lord was dead at last. And then the destruction of hope as he learned that the purpose behind all effort had also been defeated. Lily was dead.

The shock of it rolled over him and left him dazed and speechless. \emph{There must be some mistake. They must be talking of someone else.} But they were talking of Lily. And of James. And hats were tossed into the air. And professors and students hugged each other. The incongruity of the joy and the grief cut off his breath, and Severus backed away from the crazed crowd, skirting its fringes to escape the pressure of the Hall.

He needed air. Lily was dead because the Dark Lord feared her. The Dark Lord feared her because of a prophecy. A prophecy that he had overheard and reported. There was no air, and he couldn't breathe. Lily was dead because he had overheard a prophecy. There would be air at the top of the castle, and then he could breathe and think.

Severus struggled up the stairs, trying to reach the clear air where he could breathe. \emph{My fault. All my fault. I had to tell him. I had to set him on them. If I hadn't told he wouldn't have known.} Toby floated at his side and pointed to the future. The empty, bleak future in which each day he would know that Lily was dead, and each day he would know that he'd killed her.

He couldn't face that future. He couldn't face that guilt. Severus began to shut off, to close down, to lock all the parts of his brain that forced him to face the cold, desolate, empty future. No one could live in that future. It couldn't exist. It didn't exist. The air at the top of the tower existed. There he would be able to breathe.

In the midst of the jubilation, Dumbledore glanced around. Then he went to Hagrid. "Where is Professor Snape?" he asked.

"Was here a moment ago. I thought he looked pleased, thought he'd be celebrating."

"Hagrid, we must find him. We must find him at once."

"I'm sure he's just gone somewhere quiet, sir."

"No, Hagrid. We find him now."

They left the cheering crowd in the Great Hall and ran to the entrance hall with its mighty staircases. Even the ghosts were rejoicing, and Dumbledore called to one.

"Baron! Have you seen Professor Snape?"

"Potions master?" intoned the Bloody Baron. "Up, going up. In a hurry."

Dumbledore climbed, too, as fast as he could go with Hagrid right behind him. Staircase after staircase they climbed, and saw no dark robed figure in front of them. Then they were on the seventh floor, with only the towers to search. The staircase to the Astronomy Tower was in front of them, and Dumbledore raced for it as if the world depended on his speed.

Just as they reached the door out onto the top of the tower, Dumbledore slowed and turned to Hagrid. "We must move quietly. If he is out there, we do not want to startle him." They stepped onto the Tower, shadowed in starlight. To their right, facing west, they could make out a smaller shadow - Severus kneeling in the crenellated parapet.

As they watched, he rose and stood, feet at the very edge of stone, eyes fixed on the waxing crescent of the setting moon.

\emph{There is no past. There is no future. There is only now, in the starlight, in the presence of the moon. A perfect launch moon. Halfway between new and first quarter. The moon for every perfect Saturn rocket that ever carried an Apollo capsule into destiny.} Severus steepled his hands in prayer to the beckoning siren moon. The only voice he could hear or wanted to hear spoke softly in welcome: \emph{Seven... six... ignition sequence started... three... two... one... we have ignition...} and he followed it forward into space.

Hagrid moved first, faster and more quietly than he'd ever moved in his life, and as Severus fell forward, Hagrid's arms wrapped around his waist, dragged him back, and deposited him on the roof of the tower.

"Sorry to be rough, lad, but you just scared the... Whoa!"

Severus was on his feet and scrambling for the parapet again. Hagrid flung both arms wide to block him while Dumbledore tried to restrain him from behind. It would have been faster and easier if they were less concerned about not hurting him, but eventually they wrestled Severus down onto the roof where Hagrid sat pinning his arms as Dumbledore knelt beside them.

Severus buried his face against Hagrid's jacket. "I killed her," he whispered. "I want to die."

"No, no, Severus," Dumbledore insisted. "You did not kill her. You did everything you could..."

Severus wasn't listening. He didn't seem to hear. He repeated over and over, like a litany, "I killed her, I killed her... I want to die..."

Hagrid pulled Severus to his feet and steered him, now unresisting, down the spiral staircase where they met Professor Sprout, who had followed them up on the advice of the Bloody Baron.

"Oh dear," she gasped on seeing them. "Is he all right?"

"He will be fine, Pomona, do not fret. We have had a bit of excitement, but the less said about it, the better. Would you kindly find Madam Pomfrey and ask her to meet us in the hospital wing. We shall need some special arrangements and a sedative."

After a hurried consultation, Dumbledore and Madam Pomfrey agreed that the open ward wasn't the best place for a suicidal young man, so they moved one of the beds into her office where he could be more strictly confined. The hot tea they brought him there contained a powerful sleeping draught.

"Drink it down, lad. It'll do ya a world of good." Hagrid held the cup as Severus drank the tea, then lifted him, already sleeping, onto the bed and covered him with a light blanket. "Reckon he'll be okay 'til we get back?"

"I shall make certain that he is," replied Dumbledore, casting a series of binding and restraining spells. "That should hold him. Madam Pomfrey, if Professor Snape wakes before we return, try to keep him calm. Get Professor Flitwick or Professor Sprout to help you if necessary. Professor McGonagall is away from Hogwarts at the moment assisting me."

More information had come in about the terrible, wonderful events of the day, and it was now clear that though James and Lily Potter were dead, their year-old son Harry may have survived. Professor McGonagall was already keeping watch over the home of the boy's muggle aunt while Hagrid went to assess the damage at the Potters' home and see to the boy's safety.

They did not return to Hogwarts for many hours.

Severus drifted in and out of a narcotic-induced sleep for two days, until he was calm enough on waking that Madam Pomfrey decided he could do with just a tranquilizer. He remembered what happened, but it seemed distant and detached, as if he were wrapped in cotton, all sight, sound, and memory muffled. All he wanted to do was lie on his side staring mindlessly at the wall.

Dumbledore came and sat beside him. "Are you feeling better now?"

"I killed her."

"You did not kill her. You did what you could to save her. We all thought that once the Fidelius Charm was cast..."

Severus turned to look at Dumbledore. "But you were their secret-keeper. How could he find them?"

"Ah, alas. I was not, in the end, the secret-keeper. James, you see, valued his friends dearly, and for friendship's sake gave that privilege to Sirius Black, who was godfather to his son."

Severus's lethargy was gone now, replaced by a growing sense of apprehension. "Sirius betrayed them? Sirius sold them to the Dark Lord? Why? I'll kill him myself. With my bare hands."

"You will not have that chance. He has killed Peter Pettigrew as well, and has been captured and sent to Azkaban Prison. That, I assure you, will be punishment enough."

Dumbledore left, and Severus lay in the hospital bed, staring at the ceiling.

\emph{For friendship's sake? The blind, sentimental fool! To trade certain security on an emotional whim? To sell Lily to the Dark Lord in order to soothe the feelings of an unstable maniac! For friendship's sake? I can no longer touch James, but if Sirius Black is ever released from Azkaban, I'll kill him.}

Dumbledore had other problems. Rufus Scrimgeour and Alastor Moody were waiting for him in his office.

"We're starting to round up all known or suspected Death Eaters, Albus," Moody said quietly.

"What has that to do with me?"

"You've been harboring a viper in your midst. We've come to take him off your hands."

"I am certain I do not know who you mean."

Scrimgeour stepped forward impatiently. "Yes, you do. We mean Snape. He's been a Death Eater for three years, and he's going to stand trial with his comrades. We've come to arrest him."

"I fear that will be impossible. Professor Snape is, first of all, quite ill. He is being treated in the hospital wing. Of even more importance, however, is the fact that he is not a Death Eater, and I shall not let you have him."

"Albus," said Moody quietly. "I know you don't like anyone accusing your staff, but Snape is deep into Death Eater business and has been for three years. He's deceived you."

"He has not deceived me, Alastor. He has been quite truthful with me. And he is not a Death Eater."

"Maybe," Scrimgeour snarled, "he hasn't told you that he's been reporting to Voldemort every week, even after you hired him. Maybe he forgot to mention he was spilling his soul to his master as recently as last Thursday. Maybe we should haul his rear end in here and show you his left arm."

"Why Rufus! Have you been spying on my staff?"

"I spy on Death Eaters. We're arresting him, Albus."

"No. You are not. I forbid it. He is a teacher here, and you will not touch him."

Moody shook his head sorrowfully. "I don't hear you telling us why we should trust him, or why we should accept your judgment on the matter. The Ministry wants all Death Eaters in custody. His name is on the list. He's going. If not today, then next month... It's just a matter of time."

"There was a time when its being my judgment would have been enough. As for justification, when the time comes, I shall tell you as much as I can. For now, I am asking you to trust me. If you will not, it changes nothing. You cannot have him."

"Then you tell him," said Scrimgeour, "not to set foot outside Hogwarts. He leaves the grounds, he's mine."

Professor Snape was released from the hospital a week later, though he didn't immediately return to his classes, Professor Slughorn having been brought out of retirement to fill his position temporarily. Instead, Snape asked to speak to Dumbledore. Dumbledore agreed immediately, and watched the thin, austere young man with some concern. There was a new, hard edge to him, as if the last fragile trace of his childhood innocence had finally been excised. Dumbledore wanted to console him, wanted Hagrid to console him, but the shell of bitterness was too recent to want or accept comfort.

"You must look to the future," Dumbledore said gently.

"There is no future."

"You still have a life to live."

"You don't understand, do you?" Snape seemed to struggle with opposing needs to talk and be private. The need for privacy almost won. Almost. "I'm not a normal person."

"Of course you are, Se..."

"Don't patronize me! I know you and Hagrid have been trying to help me be normal. It's been a losing battle, hasn't it?" He didn't wait for Dumbledore's reply. "Not for her, though. For her it was easy."

"What do you mean?" Dumbledore said quietly, knowing this moment would never come again.

"I remember the day I shut my mother out. I don't... I never let anyone else in. I don't... think I can. Except... her. When I looked at... she looked at me... It was... all the doors... opening. It... was water... and air... and sunshine."

"Could she read you?"

"No. She didn't have the talent. But with her it was... I actually felt... like a normal... human being." Snape slumped forward in the chair, and he was crying. After a moment he looked up. "I thought... you were going... to keep her... safe..."

Dumbledore sighed. "She and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus. Were you not hoping that Lord Voldemort..."

The sharp intake of breath wasn't due just to the mention of the Dark Lord's name, and even as his sentence faded to silence, Dumbledore realized he may have pushed in the wrong direction. "Her boy survives," he finished, changing the subject.

Snape turned his face away. It was clearly not an acceptable trade. Dumbledore pushed again.

"Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes." Snape wasn't looking at him, but the tension in his body said he was listening. "You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans's eyes, I am sure?" After three and a half years.

"Don't!" Snape lashed out at him. Then he again turned away. "Gone... dead..."

"Is this remorse, Severus?"

Snape ignored Dumbledore's question. It was meaningless, as life was now meaningless. For one year life had held meaning, and now... "I wish... I wish I were dead..."

Dumbledore's voice changed. No longer gentle and sympathetic, it was now the matter-of-fact tone one uses to pull someone away from wallowing in self pity and make him focus on the task at hand. "And what use would that be to anyone? If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear."

Snape stared at Dumbledore as at a stranger. \emph{Why is he talking about love? I don't... There isn't any...} "What... what do you mean?"

"You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily's son."

It still seemed meaningless, a gesture, but Snape agreed. Agreed even though he couldn't bear the thought of seeing the boy, seeing his eyes... Agreed knowing that, despite Dumbledore's fears, there was no real danger. The Dark Lord was gone... The reason for caution and fear was gone...

Snape looked up at Dumbledore again, more in control of himself now. With some dignity, he rose to his feet. "There was something else. I've come to tell you, Headmaster, that you'll need a new Potions teacher. I'm resigning. I'll leave as soon as you have a replacement. I'll do what I've promised, but from outside Hogwarts."

"I am sorry that you are not content with us. I fear, however, that leaving is not an option."

"I beg your pardon?"

"The Ministry of Magic is currently rounding up all former followers of Lord Vol... him. Those in custody are being sent to Azkaban for interrogation. You understand, of course, about the Dementors. You are known to have been a Death Eater. The Aurors have asked me to give you to them so that they can `discuss' your former master and colleagues. I have refused. You are a member of my staff, and as long as you are employed here, they cannot touch you."

"Maybe Azkaban is what I deserve. Have you considered that?"

"My dear Severus, I see that you do not understand Dementors at all. They delight in despair. A person who has lived a life full of love, who has basked in the sunshine of good fortune, and has an abiding sense of innocence can withstand them. One who has suffered cannot. They would feast on you, drawn to your isolation, your sorrow, your guilt... And I am not talking about being a Death Eater. From the moment you turned a wand against your father at the age of nine, you have carried guilt with you like a possessing demon. The Dementors would strip every clean memory from you and force you to relive every pain, every sorrow, every fear, every humiliation, every minute of your life until only a shell of you remained. No one deserves that."

Severus sat down next to Dumbledore's desk again and cradled his head in his hands.

Dumbledore sighed. "I am sorry to be so blunt. I did not want you to make the wrong decision."

They sat together in silence for a few minutes. Then Severus raised his head and looked at Dumbledore with dead eyes. "I mean no offense, Headmaster, but there are few places I'd less like to be than Hogwarts. I have almost no happy memories of this place, and those I had are... gone. And I'm no teacher. I hate it. The only reason I came back was because I was ordered to. Now you tell me I have a choice of prisons - Azkaban or Hogwarts. Forgive me if I am less than overjoyed."

"I understand, and I am not offended. You think about it."

Severus left Dumbledore's office and stood by the tall, narrow windows in the corridor, looking down at the lake. \emph{I'm twenty-one and my life is over. No hopes, no dreams, no future. Locked in a place I hate, in a job I hate. No family, no friends, no one to talk to... No, that's wrong. I can talk to Dumbledore. I can talk to Hagrid. It could be worse...}

\emph{Thursday, November 12, 1981}

Professor Snape went first to Professor Slughorn to advise him that he, Snape, was prepared to resume his teaching duties, and to thank Professor Slughorn for filling in. Professor Slughorn thanked Professor Snape for the information, then expressed his pleasure at having been able to help and his compliments on the remarkably good behavior of Professor Snape's students. It was all very formal.

The next to be informed were the students of Slytherin house, who seemed to be uniformly pleased at his return.

"It's been hell, sir," said Algie Colfax who, though not a prefect, seemed to have been elected spokesman for the whole house. "Everyone's been acting like we're criminals or something. Even the professors are treating us different, especially Scrimgeour."

"Scrimgeour? I'd have thought he'd have gone, right after the news got out."

"We did, too, sir, and he did go for a couple of days. But then he was right back again telling us that he'd been hired for the year, and he'd be side by side with us until June."

"Side by side?" Snape said. "That's an odd way of putting it."

"And he didn't say that to any of the other houses," chimed in Marlie Kingsford. "We checked. He only said that to his Slytherin classes. Like he was threatening us."

"Okay," said Snape, "I'll keep an eye on it. And if Scrimgeour pushes it further, tell me. If he won't listen to me, I'll go to Dumbledore."

The expressions of skepticism that greeted this could not be ignored. Snape explained it in terms any Slytherin could understand. "Dumbledore doesn't like anyone trying to take over his territory. Scrimgeour's been trying to do that, and Dumbledore's been fighting him. You're Dumbledore's territory. If anyone tries to control you, it affects Dumbledore, and he'll fight back. If Scrimgeour says anything, tell me, and I'll tell Dumbledore."

They nodded, relieved to have the big guns back on their side of the battlefield.

It was Algie, a few minutes later, who told Snape that Quidditch in general had been postponed due to the news, and that the Slytherin/Gryffindor Quidditch match in particular had been postponed due to his `illness.' Gryffindor was playing Ravenclaw in two days, and the Slytherin/Gryffindor match would be in May.

Then there were the other teachers. After supper, Snape joined them in the staff room. His reception was chilly. After a few minutes, Flitwick suggested cribbage, and then said they might go to the Great Hall where it was quieter than in the staff room. Once in the Hall, however, Flitwick had other things to talk about in addition to the cribbage.

"Do you know what he's been saying about you?"

"What?" Snape asked, already growing wary.

"Everyone knows you collapsed on Halloween right after the news. Scrimgeour's been whispering to everyone that it was because you were distraught that You-Know-Who was dead. He's hinting that you were a Death Eater." Flitwick clearly wanted Snape to deny this.

"Rufus Scrimgeour is about as clueless a personality as I have ever met," was Snape's response.

"Then it's not true?"

"No, it's not true." Snape didn't elaborate on which part wasn't true

"Well, thank goodness for that," said Flitwick, and they played cribbage until ten, went on their rounds, and retired for the night.

\emph{Friday, November 13, 1981}

The next morning, Scrimgeour arrived early and made a point of being at breakfast, something he'd not done all term. Passing up the Hall and down the staff table to his seat by Dumbledore, he paused to whisper in Snape's ear, "You and I are going to `talk,' Death Eater," then smiled evilly and took his seat. For the entire meal, whenever Dumbledore's attention was elsewhere, he would look down the table at Snape. Once he even drew a finger across his throat.

Later that day, right before lunch, Algie Colfax came into the Potions classroom as Snape was clearing up from his last morning class.

"You've got to come, Professor, right away. Anna Prendergast's father was arrested last night, and Professor Scrimgeour just told her she has to stay in his class all lunch hour because she's on detention, but she didn't do anything. The others in her class say he was yelling at her like she was under arrest herself."

Snape was out of his classroom in an instant, heading for the Dark Arts room.

Up the marble staircase to the first floor, then along a corridor, and Snape paused in front of the Dark Arts classroom. He could hear Scrimgeour's voice inside.

"How old are you! I'll tell you. You're fifteen. Fifteen and you don't know the names of the people who come to your parents' house for dinner! You never struck me as stupid before, girl, so maybe you're just a garden variety liar!"

Snape opened the door and entered the room. Both Scrimgeour and Prendergast looked over at him in surprise. The girl was crying. Scrimgeour smiled. "Good morning, Professor Snape."

"Good morning, Professor Scrimgeour. I see you've detained a member of my house. May I ask why?"

"She was insolent to me in class this morning."

"No, Professor, I didn't..."

"Be quiet, please, Miss Prendergast." Anna obeyed. "If a professor says a student has been insolent, it is my experience that the professor is usually right. So, Professor Scrimgeour, what task have you decided to set for Miss Prendergast?"

"Task?"

"Detention generally involves setting a task for the delinquent student to perform. A school-related task. Cleaning desks, or copying out new signs and notices, for example."

Scrimgeour glowered. "Miss Prendergast can start cleaning the desks."

As Anna rose to comply, Snape sat down at one of the desks in question. "Excellent. Since I need to consult with Miss Prendergast on a house-related matter, I'll just wait here and watch until she's finished her assignment. I hope you don't mind."

It looked for a moment as if Scrimgeour were about to explode, then he became suddenly calm again. "I've changed my mind. You're released from detention." He crossed to the door and opened it, gesturing to Anna to leave. "Go. I don't want you here."

An immensely relieved Anna scurried from the room, and Snape also rose to go. Scrimgeour, however, closed the door again and leaned against it, his arms folded across his chest. "I don't want you to go, though," he said quietly. "Sit down."

"I prefer to stand, thank you."

"Suit yourself. I gave Dumbledore fair warning. I'm a sporting man, so I wanted to be sure the warning was passed on." Scrimgeour moved slowly away from the door. "You belong to me. I mean that literally. Your name's been on my case list since I got this assignment. I've lost a lot of friends in the past years, and you and your lot are going to pay. Now that lord of yours is gone, your pals are all singing like canaries, and you'll sing, too. A private little concert at the Ministry just for me. You think you can hide under Dumbledore's skirts like a sniveling little rat, but all I need is one whisker outside that gate, and you've said good-bye to Hogwarts."

Scrimgeour was close to Snape now, forcing Snape to look up at his face. He was taller, stronger, more athletic, and Snape fought a powerful instinct to back away from his menace. Then, like the lion he resembled, Scrimgeour pounced and seized Snape's left wrist in an iron grip, wrenching it down onto the desk.

"Why don't we just roll this sleeve up and prove me right?" he said with a smile, and stared directly into Snape's eyes.

The legilimency contact was strong, but Snape didn't care. He was shut down as tightly as he could be, and he let Scrimgeour know it. After a moment Scrimgeour released both his eyes and his wrist. "Dumbledore was right," he said. "You're good."

"Good?" Snape responded. "That was blatant and heavy-handed. No subtlety at all. I wouldn't waste `good' on you."

"You think I can't get past those barriers? Have you ever tried Veritaserum, Snape?" When Snape didn't answer, Scrimgeour smiled again and continued. "I have. We all have to. You can fight it, you know. You can concentrate on keeping your mouth shut, and you can fight it. You can't fight what goes on inside your head. Everything starts expanding, pushing, breaking to the surface, like steam in a boiling kettle. Talking releases the pressure, so fighting it is - unpleasant. Painful, even. It isn't too bad for most people, though. Most people have fairly open minds."

Scrimgeour's face was close to Snape's now, grinning again. "There's been speculation on what would happen if you gave Veritaserum to an instinctive occlumens. Imagine your poor little brain struggling to keep all those barriers up, all those doors closed, while the drug in your veins smashes them down. Shatters them. Pressure building until you think your mind is going to explode. Until the wreckage of your defenses lies strewn in pieces in a ruined brain, and you spend the rest of your life in the looney bin at St. Mungo's."

Snape was trembling, his eyes wide with horror, and Scrimgeour stepped away, content with the progress he'd just made. "I wouldn't even ask you any questions. I'd just sit back and watch. Maybe take notes." He turned and walked over to the door. "You've been warned. Don't leave Hogwarts."

The door was open, and Snape was through it, heading down to the dungeons and the safety of his own rooms, fear lodged in the pit of his stomach, a new and now permanent part of his being.

Snape was never sure how he made it through his afternoon classes, with Scrimgeour now a looming threat in the front of his mind. As soon as the last student was out of the last class, he hurried up to the seventh floor with a request to speak to Dumbledore. By the time he was in the office, he was nearly hysterical.

"He threatened me! He detained a student whose father's under arrest so he could interrogate her about her family contacts, and then he threatened me! Look at this! He could have broken my wrist!" Small purple bruises marked the place where Scrimgeour's fingers had pressed into Snape's skin.

"He has left the school for the weekend by now. Why did you not come to me immediately? I should have enjoyed having a word or two with Mr. Scrimgeour." Dumbledore was calm, but his underlying anger was also evident.

"I had classes. No, that's not true. I mean it's true, but it's not the reason. I was afraid. I couldn't think clearly because I was scared. Professor, what happens when you give... Veritaserum to... to someone like me?"

Dumbledore's eyes reflected his concern. He filled a goblet with mead and steered Snape to a chair. "Sit down. Take this, it will do you good, help you calm down. I take it that Veritaserum was part of the threat. I shall be honest with you, Severus. No one knows. A born occlumens is rarer than hens' teeth. Many people do not believe they exist. I am not young, and I have known only one in my whole life." Dumbledore raised his own glass to Snape.

"That does not mean there are not others, of course. I imagine one could be born an occlumens and go through one's whole life without anyone else ever finding out. The occlumens might never realize it himself. But documented cases... So the whole question of what happens when an occlumens meets Veritaserum is more in the realm of philosophical speculation than of scientific experimentation. It is rather like immovable objects and irresistible forces. The currently accepted answer is that the occlumens's natural instincts would battle the drug, resulting in serious, if not irreparable, damage to the brain. Naturally, no one has stepped forward offering to test this hypothesis."

"Scrimgeour wants to test it," said Snape. "He made it sound like he'd enjoy doing it, too."

"Rufus Scrimgeour is an angry, bitter man. Most of the aurors are. They, more than anyone, have been at the forefront of this war, and they have seen the worst. He was a good friend of the whole Bones family, you know, and of Marlene McKinnon and Dorcas Meadows. He is not likely at this point to respond to requests for clemency. The best thing for you is to stay out of his way."

"What if he attacks my students again?"

"I shall make a request to the Ministry to have him removed. Do not count on that working, however. I myself have wondered if his appointment here did not have something to do with internal politics at the Ministry. The whole question of placing an auror at Hogwarts was suspect from the beginning."

"Why didn't you say anything?"

"Oh, I did. Several times. Just not to you or to the other teachers. There is no point in creating discord and conflict when you have no hope of resolving it. I shall, in any case, tell Rufus that if he has need to impose detention on any of the students in the future, he should leave it to Professor McGonagall to decide the proper punishment. Meanwhile, if he goes for you again, come to me at once. And for the time being, I would follow his advice."

"Which advice."

"Do not leave Hogwarts."

The next day was the Gryffindor - Ravenclaw Quidditch match. Scrimgeour wasn't at Hogwarts, so Snape was able to relax a little and pay attention to the game. Instead of sitting in the teachers' stands, he joined Algie and Chris with the Slytherin students and got a personal analysis of everything that happened.

Gryffindor was powerful, as usual, but Ravenclaw was fired with enthusiasm plus two new Chasers and a new Seeker. As Seeker battled Seeker for the Snitch, sometimes crashing into each other in a dive, the score climbed higher and higher until both teams were near one hundred fifty points just scoring with the Quaffle. It was still anybody's game, and the stands were wild with excitement.

"This isn't good for us," mourned Algie. "If we win all our games, we'll get the cup, but if it comes down to two teams with two wins each, the team with the overall highest cumulative score is the cup winner."

Then the Seekers went into a heart-stopping dive that had the whole school on its feet, and the game was over, the Gryffindor Seeker circling the field in triumph, the Snitch raised high in his hand. The score was Gryffindor 290, Ravenclaw 150.

The Slytherin team increased its practice sessions, for they were playing Hufflepuff in December.

For a few weeks, Scrimgeour left Snape alone. Hagrid didn't though. "That," he told Snape at breakfast on Monday morning a week later, "wouldn't keep a sparrow alive, much less a fully growed human being."

"It's perfectly adequate. I prefer a continental breakfast."

"Ya used t' prefer kippers and toast. Much healthier, that. Besides, even in a good year ya never had too much meat on those bones. Ya can't afford t' get any skinnier. I could pick ya up and break ya like a toothpick, I could."

"Hagrid, you could do that with any person here, including Max Kettleburn. If I eat too much I'll get sick."

"If ya don't eat enough, ya'll die. Course, if ya want t' make Rufus Scrimgeour happier than he already is..."

"I am not making Scrimgeour happy!"

"No? Look at ya. Pining away with a nervous stomach. Jumpy as a cat in a roomful of rocking chairs. He's got yer measure, he's pushing all yer buttons, and y're letting him do it."

"I am not!" Snape insisted, helping himself to a kipper and another cup of coffee. "Besides, how would you know?"

"I got eyes, ain't I? Ya should see yerself when he walks into a room. Looking anywhere but at him, melting into the background, escaping as quick as you can... Ya got a classic case of the heebie-jeebies. Not that I blame ya, mind ya. He's a scary customer, especially for someone as naturally timid as you are."

"I am not timid!" Snape retorted in a voice that was a touch too loud, causing students and teachers at the tables nearby to turn and look at him. He lowered his voice immediately. "I am not timid. I've faced his kind before and come out on top." Which was not quite true, since the only time Snape had faced someone specifically out to get him was as a student against James Potter and Sirius Black, and the teenage Potter and Black were not in Scrimgeour's league at all.

"Ya can keep telling yerself that, lad. And ya can keep telling me in any tone ya want what y're not, but 'til I see it..." Hagrid rose and left, his mission accomplished, for Snape had finished the kipper and two pieces of toast, but Snape was left with more to think about.

\emph{Saturday, December 5, 1981 (one day after the first quarter)}

The day of the Slytherin - Hufflepuff Quidditch game dawned frosty and clear. Despite the cold, it seemed the entire school was making its way to the Quidditch field after lunch, for rumor had it that this would be an exciting game. Hufflepuff always had highly competent teams, and the new Slytherin team was expected to show more potential than Slytherin house had exhibited in years. Even Professor Dumbledore came down to watch the match.

They were not disappointed. The Gryffindor - Ravenclaw match had been a high-scoring competition between Chasers and Seekers. The Slytherin - Hufflepuff match was an equally tense bout between Beaters and Keepers. Chasers ran play after play at the hoops, only to be met by save after spectacular save. The Beaters kept up constant interference, forcing the Chasers into injury-defying maneuvers to avoid them, and one incredibly aimed Bludger even knocked the Snitch itself away from the Hufflepuff Seeker's hand. The broom work was superb, the precision of the players breathtaking, and when, in a neck-and-neck race, the Slytherin Seeker emerged victorious with the Snitch, the stands erupted in a deafening roar. The score was 170 to 30.

"Whoever would have thought," said McGonagall as she cheerfully paid Kettleburn his galleon, "that a defensive game would be so exciting."

\emph{Thursday, December 10, 1981 (the day before the full moon)}

The term was almost over. Tests, projects, and last-minute papers were being turned in, and with only Friday left for classes, Snape came to the staff room in the hour before supper feeling rather pleased with the way things had gone. The term was successfully completed, all his students had done reasonably well, there would be one more Hogsmeade excursion on Saturday that he was excused from supervising because of Scrimgeour, and then three blessed weeks of the Christmas break. The general atmosphere was one of good cheer and relaxation.

Filch stuck his head in the door. "Begging your pardon, Professors, but Professor Dumbledore would like to see Professor Snape in his office right away."

Snape excused himself and hurried upstairs, feeling only mild apprehension at the summons. He was relieved to find, as he got to the seventh floor, that Hagrid had been called, too, though he was mystified as to why Dumbledore would want to see both of them.

As Snape stepped into Dumbledore's office, however, all sense of ease vanished, for with Dumbledore were four men - Scrimgeour, the auror named Moody, and two others. "Ah, Severus," said Dumbledore, "come in. You know Mr. Scrimgeour and Mr. Moody. These other gentlemen are Mr. Robards and Mr. Dawlish, also of Law Enforcement. They are here..."

Scrimgeour moved forward, interrupting Dumbledore. "Severus Snape," he said, pulling a piece of parchment from his robes, "you are under arrest for complicity in the attack upon Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom. You are hereby in my custody, and will accompany me to London at once."

"No," said Snape, completely mystified, "that's not right. He didn't go after the Longbottoms, he went..."

"Severus!" said Dumbledore sharply, and Snape was quiet. "Rufus," Dumbledore continued, "I am still opposed to this, so I do not see how you can take him to London..."

"I am amazed," Scrimgeour said, his voice trembling with emotion, "utterly amazed how you, of all people, can treat this so casually. Frank and Alice are in St. Mungo's and may not live the night. Their attackers remain unidentified and could go after any of us at any time. Do you see this little piece of Death Eater trash?" He took a step toward Snape, but Hagrid came between them. "This piece of dung is holding names and locations in his head, and for four and a half months you haven't allowed us to touch him. If even one of those names belongs to someone who attacked Frank and Alice, I'm holding you personally responsible for their deaths, Albus. You. Personally."

Moody intervened. "I'm sorry, Albus. Rufus is right. If Mr. Snape is a Death Eater, you should have let us question him months ago. Now we've lost two more people, something that might have been prevented. We have to take him in. If you stand in the way, we may have to take you, too. Move aside, Hagrid."

Hagrid wouldn't budge until Dumbledore said, "Do as he says, Hagrid." Moody stepped forward and took Snape's left arm as Snape looked away from his face and his eyes. Turning the arm so the palm of Snape's hand faced up, Moody pushed back the sleeves of robe and shirt to expose the skull and snake brand.

It was Scrimgeour who spoke. "You can't deny it, Albus. He's a Death Eater."

"I can deny it, Rufus, and I do. Severus was a Death Eater. For the past year and more he has been working for me. He ceased being Voldemort's servant long before Voldemort died."

"You still should have let us talk to him," said Moody.

"Not if he was under arrest," replied Dumbledore.

"This is ridiculous!" Scrimgeour shouted. "You don't stop being a Death Eater! You! Trash! How many people have you killed?"

Snape glanced at Dumbledore, then stared at the floor. "I haven't killed anybody," he said.

"LIAR!"

"Rufus," said Dumbledore quietly, "I do not take kindly to others attacking the integrity of my staff. I must ask you to leave now. Professor Snape stays here."

"You dare!" Scrimgeour screamed. "You dare! With Frank and Alice clinging to life in the hospital, you dare! What about us, Albus? What about the people who've had their lives on the line for ten years? I'm not going to do what his friends did. I'm not going to Cruciate him. I'm going to talk to him!"

Robards laid a hand on Scrimgeour's arm. "Easy, Rufus. This is hard for all of us. Thing's have changed, Albus. You haven't seen what they did to Frank and Alice. It must have lasted for hours. Even if they live, they're not coming back to us. There's not an auror in the Ministry who won't move heaven and earth to catch the ones who did it. They'll come after you here in Hogwarts. And Rufus is right. If we find that this young man was holding a scrap of information that could have led to the arrest of these monsters before they attacked Frank and Alice... well, there are few who will forgive you. We're not leaving Hogwarts without him."

"Interrogate him here, Gawain."

"We have a warrant for his arrest signed by the Minister. If you hinder us, we'll arrest you, too. Albus, come to London, talk to Crouch. Arrange to have custody, on your recognizance, before his hearing. Just don't obstruct. Make a good faith effort to show everyone you're just as careful about our welfare as you are about his. This could be all over and him back at Hogwarts before tomorrow morning."

There was silence, then Dumbledore said softly, "Do not drag him out as a criminal before the whole school. Grant him some dignity..."

"Professor!" Snape screamed, jerking backwards in a sudden desperate and futile effort to flee. "Please, Professor! Don't let them..." but the aurors were already moving in, binding his wrists in front of him and taking his wand.

"Severus, listen," said Dumbledore, coming forward and grasping Snape's shoulders, locking their gazes. "They are right. What has happened to the Longbottoms has changed everything. If I do not let you go now, this will never end as long as you are alive. They will hunt you down wherever you are. I will come for you. We shall observe all the rules, and I will come for you. I will not leave you there alone."

The one concession the aurors made was to wait until the school was assembled in the Great Hall for supper before leading their prisoner down the stairs and out of the castle to apparate with him to the Ministry in London. The only one who witnessed Snape's departure in disgrace was, by chance, McGonagall. She watched in silence as the sad little procession passed, Dumbledore and Hagrid in the rear, then went into the Hall, but kept her own counsel about what she had seen.

From the moment they left Hogwarts, Snape was terrified. A large part of it was the physical menace. He was in the power of men who were bigger than he was, stronger than he was, and who hated him, but this had happened before in school with Sirius and James. And yet in school there had always been the knowledge that if authority intervened - a prefect, a professor, the headmaster - that intervention would save him. Now his captors were the authority, and there was nothing outside the pure force of Dumbledore's personality, so recently demonstrated to be weak, that could possibly bring salvation.

Snape was helpless, and they made sure he knew it. Once they entered the Ministry, he was not allowed to simply walk. He was pushed, pulled, dragged, and shoved. To emphasize orders, he was cuffed and slapped. No hand or voice was gentle, and as soon as he was hauled into the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, the sleeve on his left arm was pushed up so that everyone who came into contact with him would know that he was a Death Eater. The hatred in their eyes was palpable.

The first formal stop was a tiny office with a long counter and a hard-eyed clerk. "Name?" she asked.

"Snape, Severus," replied Scrimgeour.

"Offense?"

"Death Eater."

"I've got space on the docket for February tenth. Preliminary hearing on the tenth, judicial review on the fifteenth. Trial on March 9. Can't give you earlier than that. Recommendation for bail?"

"None," said Scrimgeour.

"No bail," said the clerk. "I suppose you'll want to hold him here for a few days. You can have room 3B until a week from tomorrow, the eighteenth. After that he'll have to go to Azkaban, block A, cell nine. There's been a sudden vacancy. Suicide apparently."

"Good," said Scrimgeour. "One other thing. Albus Dumbledore." The clerk looked up, suddenly interested. "Dumbledore'll be coming in about this one. Keep him busy with paperwork as long as you can. I need a few hours."

"You got it."

Room 3B was small and entirely white, with a table and a few chairs. Scrimgeour shoved Snape into it with such force that he slammed side and arm against the table and dropped to the floor. The four aurors hauled him to his feet again and pushed him into one of the chairs. At that moment another clerk came by and whispered something to Scrimgeour and Moody. The aurors conferred.

Scrimgeour pulled out his wand and with a flourish fastened Snape's wrists to the table with a binding spell. "That was about Frank and Alice," he growled. "They're going to live, but they'll be in the psychiatric ward at St. Mungo's for the rest of their lives. That's your fault, Death Eater."

"Ease up!" snapped Moody. "We want names, not a witness with a fried brain. You back off 'til we get what we need."

"Then I fry him."

"Please," Snape stammered, "please, I... don't... know any... names."

Scrimgeour thrust his hand into the hair at the nape at Snape's neck and jerked his head back. "No? The names know you. You want to hear what we have on you? You brewed potions for them. Not just medicines, but forgetfulness potions and Polyjuice. They got to Edgar Bones because they bypassed the dog. And we know who created the spell to get around the dog. And the fighting classes - the drop, roll, and come up shooting. I've faced that myself, and that was you."

Robards laid a hand on Scrimgeour's. "Watch it," he said. "We've got a writ for questioning, not for torture."

"I don't want questioning. I want justice. Justice puts him slobbering mindlessly in the same ward as Frank Longbottom."

A messenger came then, and Robards and Dawlish left. Moody leaned in to murmur to Snape. "Names, all I need is names. Look, he's not rational anymore, and all he wants is to hurt you like his friends have been hurt. But if you give me names, I can help you."

"But I don't... know any... names," Snape whimpered. He was beginning to sob with fear.

"You poor, naive little bastard. Everyone we've had in here has talked about you. You're one of the key people at Voldemort's headquarters. There's not a Death Eater who won't sacrifice you to save himself. When heads start to roll, yours is the first on the chopping block."

Then the messenger came that called Moody away. Before the clerk left, Scrimgeour took his arm. "I want water," he said. "A pitcher and a couple of glasses." The door closed and Scrimgeour struck Snape across the face, backhanded and hard. "Your friends are all gone," he snarled. "It's you and me now."

The clerk returned with the pitcher and the glasses. He left, the door closed, and Scrimgeour slowly poured a glassful of water. "Poor little Death Eater," he crooned. "Couldn't take the strain. They left for just a few minutes, and he cracked." Scrimgeour pulled a small vial out of his pocket. "The dose is three drops," he said, measuring it carefully into the water. "But who cares about doses?" and he upended the entire contents of the vial into the glass.

"I don't know any names!" Snape shrieked, struggling desperately against the bonds, kicking himself from the chair and wrenching wrists and arms in panic.

"I don't want any names," replied Scrimgeour, pulling Snape's head back again, forcing his mouth open to receive the Veritaserum.

Snape broke. "Lestrange!" he screamed, "Rodolphus and Bella Lestrange! Rabastan Lestrange! Walden Macnair! Antonin Dolohov!"

Suddenly the tiny room was full of people, taking notes and pushing him for another name, and another... Scrimgeour had melted into the background, but Snape didn't notice.

"Amycus Carrow! Fenrir Greyback! Igor Karkaroff!" Captured Death Eaters, dead Death Eaters, it didn't matter, as long as he could give them names, any names, all the names. "Alecto Carrow! Barty Crouch! Evan Rosier!"

Moody turned to Scrimgeour and Robards. "That's the third one that's named Barty Crouch. I say we send a squad to pick him up."

Robards looked uneasy. "Do we tell Mr. Crouch first?"

"No," said Scrimgeour. "Get young master Barty first. Then we let his father know."

"But Crouch is head..."

"Not anymore. Not after this. Barty may be our key to the others. Do you want to risk his getting away?"

Robards shook his head and left to organize the arrest squad.

They unbound Snape and let him crawl to one side of the room, to cower in a corner with his arms wrapped around his head. It was forty-five more minutes before they let Dumbledore and Hagrid through, by which time Snape had become quieter.

Dumbledore was furious. "What have you done to him? Have you no decency? No shame? You would treat animals better than this!"

"We didn't hurt him, Albus. I swear." Moody protested. "We just scared him a little."

"A little! I promised him protection, and you betrayed me. Have you any idea how many years I have worked to gain his trust, and now you make a mockery of my word? I swear, too, Alastor. I swear I will never again allow the Ministry to take any of my people out of Hogwarts. Get out of my sight."

"Albus, we've been friends..."

"And maybe with the passage of time we will be again. But not now, Alastor. Not now."

Hagrid had lowered himself to the floor and coaxed Snape away from the corner. "It's all right, lad," he muttered. "It's over now. They ain't touching you again. We're going back home, back to Hogwarts. Ain't nobody touching you anymore."

They got Snape to his feet and, in the shelter of Hagrid's bulk, led him from the Department of Law Enforcement. One more burden remained, however. Gawain Robards came over to Dumbledore, humble and apologetic. "He has a hearing," he said.

"What?" thundered Dumbledore.

"A hearing. February tenth. And a trial date of March ninth."

Dumbledore didn't deign to reply. Gathering Hagrid and Snape, he swept from the Ministry of Magic in a rage and apparated back to Hogwarts. Snape was taken immediately to the hospital wing and put to bed with a sleeping draught. Hagrid spent the entire night at his bedside, keeping watch.

For two full days, Snape lay on the bed in the hospital, refusing to eat, refusing to drink, refusing to respond to anyone. The only reaction they got from him was when Hagrid tried to get him to take a glass of water. Snape became violent, and attacked Hagrid with as much force as could be expected from someone his size against someone Hagrid's size. At that point Dumbledore relented and contacted Moody for full details, finding out about the threat of Veritaserum and the forced drinking of a glass of water.

"What are we going to do?" Dumbledore asked Pomfrey. "If he will not drink anything, he will die."

"If he would eat, we could keep him going for a short time with foods that have a high water content - certain kinds of melons, tomatoes, soup - but he isn't eating either. Muggles stick hollow needles into veins and force fluids into their patients."

"We may have to resort to force. It is not a situation that can extend over a long period of time."

Sunday morning, after most of the students had left Hogwarts on their Christmas break, Dumbledore came to sit with Snape. Even though Snape would pay no attention, Dumbledore talked, constant repetition on essentially the same theme.

"It is my fault, of course. All my fault. I am a foolish, arrogant old man, and I made promises I could not fulfill. I duped you into believing I could protect you, and then without warning I flung you unprepared into the lions' den. I do not believe you have ever before been thrust into a situation without at least a little warning of what was to come. It was unforgivable of me, and I do not expect you to forgive me. I should be punished."

As the litany continued, it emphasized less and less the question of Dumbledore's promises, and more and more the question of Dumbledore's punishment, until around noon, Dumbledore said, "I shall be punished, and it will be now."

He conjured a brazier and set it where Snape would have to see it if his eyes were open. Then Dumbledore filled it with coals and lit them, letting them burn until the air above them shimmered with heat. When the coals were hot, Dumbledore held his hand over them. Within a few seconds, his face beaded with sweat. A few seconds more, and Snape said, "Don't do this."

Dumbledore withdrew his hand immediately. "You are talking to me again. I am pleased."

"I don't... you... You don't have to have to prove that you're brave and I'm a coward. I know that."

"You are not a coward, Severus. Please do not think that I could believe that even for an instant. Just now I faced physical pain over which I had total control. At any moment, when I desired it, I could pull my hand away. You faced insanity, total loss of self, in a situation over which, once begun, no one had control. It would have been unstoppable. Forgive me, but the two situations are not analogous at all."

Snape was silent, but his eyes were open and he was watching Dumbledore. It was an improvement. Then he said, "It would have been better if I'd gone mad or died. I'm no use to anyone."

That, Dumbledore reasoned, was a plea for help and understanding. A corner had been turned. "I do not think Anna Prendergast would agree with you. Or Algie Colfax, or any of the students in Slytherin house. You help more people than you realize. And then there is the pleasure you provide - to Professor Flitwick with his card game, and to Professor Kettleburn with Quidditch. Our lives are made of thousands and thousands of little things. If we lose you, it will diminish us."

"But I surrendered to them. I gave other people to them."

"I will admit, Severus, that that part is hard for me to understand. They have arrested Barty Crouch, and it appears he was indeed involved in the attack on the Longbottoms. They are interrogating him now. But it was a monstrous thing he did, to torture another human being into insanity. I do not understand why you wished to protect him. Or any of them."

"They were my coworkers, my colleagues, my mates. You... you don't peach on your mates."

"Loyalty. You will forgive me if I lament that so pure a motive might be used in support of so foul a reality. So we return to a central issue. If it had not been Lily that Moriarty pursued, would you have come to me?"

"No," said Snape. "I wouldn't have."

"You do recall that you have a hearing on February tenth, and that I shall be called as a witness?"

"I know."

"At least we base our relationship on honesty. It is more than most people could say. Severus, I am hungry and I am going to have lunch and a nice cup of tea. Would you join me?"

"Yes, sir. I think I would like that."

Word came to Dumbledore from the Ministry that Barty Crouch had implicated all three of the Lestranges, Rabastan, Rodolphus, and Bella, in the Longbottom affair. A massive manhunt was under way. Snape was once again plunged into a black depression.

"If they're caught, it's my fault. I gave them to the aurors."

"They will be punished for what they did to Frank and Alice. You are not responsible for that." Dumbledore watched Snape with some concern. They were in Snape's office since once again Snape had not come to lunch.

"Scrimgeour thinks I am. Moody thinks I am. If they'd been able to question me earlier, they might have stopped it. You should have handed me over."

"Knowing you would resist? Knowing the pressure they would apply? Torture is unacceptable, whether physical or psychological."

"Not even as punishment for crimes?"

"Not even then."

"What about dementors? Don't they count? I've given them to the dementors. I don't deserve to live."

\emph{Friday, December 18, 1981 (the last quarter)}

Early Friday morning, Dumbledore received an owl from Alastor Moody telling him that the Lestranges had been captured. He met Snape going in to breakfast and passed the news to him. Snape immediately returned to his own rooms, locked the door, and began to pace.

\emph{My fault, all my fault. She protected me. She defended me from James and Sirius, and I pay her by giving her to dementors. Because they were right. I am a sniveling little coward, no better than pond scum. Look at me. They push me around a little, shove me in a room, it didn't take them half an hour and I told them everything they wanted. They didn't even have to hurt me.}

But there had been the Veritaserum. The fear, the overwhelming fear not of dying but of worse than dying. Of losing yourself and never being able to come back. \emph{Coward. I'm a coward. I should have let him do it. Should have taken the drug and betrayed no one.}

Snape glanced around the office. \emph{Poisons. I have poisons here. I can finish here what Scrimgeour started. Justice.} He unlocked the cabinet with the poisons and started examining the jars. It had to be the right one. Then he stopped, remembering. Moving a small stool to the cabinet so he could reach the top shelf, Snape shifted tins and bottles until he found the tiny vial he wanted - the school's own strictly controlled supply of Veritaserum.

A small glass, a little water, the preparations took seconds. Snape sat at his desk staring at the glass for a moment, then unstoppered the vial and carefully measured three drops into the water. Scrimgeour had emptied the entire vial into his glass, but the supply belonged to Hogwarts rather than to Snape, and three drops were sufficient. He picked up the glass, looked around the office, then quickly drank the Veritaserum.

Pressure was building in Snape's head as the thoughts pushed their way to the outer edges of his mind, pleading to be released. He fought it, fought to keep his mouth closed, to stay silent. For a moment he lost control, hearing a voice begging, `Ask me a question, please ask me a question,' and realizing it was his own. He cupped his hands over his face, fearing that the pressure in his head might push his eyes from their sockets, but his hands found no change in eyes or face or head. The pressure was all in his brain, and he knew he could relieve it by talking. He struggled to remain quiet.

And then it was over. The pressure was gone. Snape blinked a few times and shook his head, but the pressure was unquestionably gone. He looked at the clock. A little over an hour had passed from the time he drank the potion.

"Severus! Severus, open this door, please, or you will oblige me to break it down. Severus!" Lunch had started, and a worried Dumbledore was checking on him. Without moving from the desk, Snape pointed his wand at the door and unlocked it.

Dumbledore immediately registered the presence of the glass and vial, and their significance. He bent over Snape, who was sitting hunched and mute, staring at the top of the desk. "What have you done, Severus? Can you hear me? Do you understand what I am saying?"

Snape nodded dumbly, then spoke. "Veritaserum doesn't affect an occlumens any differently from anyone else."

"Thank goodness for that," said Dumbledore. "Please come outside, into the fresh air..."

"Don't you understand?" said Snape, and his voice was toneless and dull. "It never would have hurt me. If I'd been brave for five seconds that night, I'd have discovered that. Brave for five seconds and strong for an hour, and I wouldn't have told them anything. All I needed was a moment of courage, and I didn't have it."
