\subsection{Chapter 59: Chapter 59 â€“ Evading the Inevitable}

\textbf{Too Much for Granted: Evading the Inevitable}

The new shields for the laboratory worked perfectly. Neither Snape nor Yaxley even had to think about them, passing through the doorway as if there were nothing there, but everyone else soon became very wary of them. Aside from blocking any entrance or casual penetration, the shields gave a mild but uncomfortable electric shock. Messengers from the Dark Lord learned to stand well away and call out to Snape or Yaxley if either of the two was wanted.

Snape also noticed that he could `see' the shield. Although itself invisible, the shield affected the quality of the air visible on the other side, producing a faint shimmer. When he mentioned this to Yaxley, he got a quizzical look in response, though later that day Yaxley admitted he could see it, too. They spoke of it to no one else.

Near the end of February, Snape was called to the interview chamber.

"Dumbledore gets no closer to his goal."

"I don't know, Lord. He doesn't confide in me about everything. There's no one to whom he reveals everything."

"But he has investigated both the Gaunt and the Peverell families. And the legends of Salazar Slytherin."

"Lord, he has."

"Then he must be nearing a conclusion. How goes it with young Malfoy."

"He's seldom seen in the castle. There's somewhere he goes to work on his task. I don't know where it is, but I know he's conscientious about the job you've given him to do. It's a great honor for one so young to be entrusted with his Lord's work, a great honor for the family. His father would be proud..."

"Silence." Pain flickered and spiked on the edges of feeling. The chamber grew suddenly chill. "Do not speak for that worthless traitor. He was given charge of that which was ours, and chose to use it for his own ends. He will understand before he dies what it is to lose what does not belong to him, and how far our arm stretches in vengeance. He will learn in Azkaban of the destruction of the last of his house."

Snape felt the blood drain from his face and limbs, and grew suddenly faint as realization dawned. "Forgive me, Lord. It is not my place to know everything, but you have charged me to see that young Malfoy works unhindered. Is it your design that he fail in his task?"

The Dark Lord laughed, high and cold. "No, Severus. It is our intention that he succeed, and that he fall in the midst of his success. See that Malfoy is not hindered. When he faces the task, you will understand."

"Yes, Lord."

To all appearances, Snape was calm as he left the chamber, but appearances can be deceptive. The equation upon which Dumbledore was constructing his plans was inaccurate. Draco's downfall was to come with success, not failure, and if Snape took Draco's task from him, the Dark Lord would be... displeased. The future was looking worse and worse all the time.

There had been a time during the last three years when the mental communication between Snape and Dumbledore had proceeded with the measured pace of spoken conversation, but that time was long past. When they wished, their eyes could meet and the words flash with the speed of thought, whole messages conveyed back and forth in a few seconds. The experience was not comfortable for Snape, since it required maintaining eye contact with Dumbledore, something he was not always willing to do.

Now, the weight of his new knowledge burdening him with worry and fear, Snape caught Dumbledore's eye on the way to his seat at breakfast the following morning.

\emph{The situation is not what we thought. I have to talk to you.}

\emph{Now? Or at lunch time when we will be less obvious?}

\emph{Lunch will do. It's important, not urgent.}

The exchange had lasted the space of two heartbeats.

"Don't you see, sir, that if I perform Malfoy's task, neither of us will have anywhere to go? The Order will be after us, the Dark Lord will be after us, and you won't be there to protect us. At least if you're alive, you can protect Malfoy here at Hogwarts. How can I watch over Malfoy if I have nowhere to go that's safe?"

They were walking out on the lawn while the rest of the school ate lunch in the Great Hall. Snape had stopped at the edge of the cliff and was looking down at the lake. Dumbledore stood a little behind him. "As you said, the situation has changed. There are still so many variables and unknowns that I do not wish as yet to rule out any scenarios, but this information requires careful consideration."

Snape didn't move, didn't allow their eyes to meet. "You'll pardon me, sir, but it's ruled out one or two for me."

"I must ask you not to be so hasty concerning what you will and what you will not permit yourself to do. I need to think about this. Let us speak again when I have reviewed the options. In a day or two?"

"Yes, Lord."

Snape turned and reentered the building, not looking at Dumbledore, not wanting to see his face, or his eyes...

By Thursday evening, Snape was as nervous and irritable as he'd ever been in his life. He was going down to Birmingham Friday night, wouldn't be back until Saturday supper, and was giving up hope of being able to talk to Dumbledore again before that happened. To make matters worse, in his hypersensitive mood he was intensely aware of the actions of people around him - people he'd only allowed on the edges of his consciousness for several months now.

Take Slughorn, for example. Was it Snape's imagination, or did the old fool seem to be wary, even nervous around Potter? For a couple of weeks, Snape had been vaguely aware that Slughorn was more attentive to the behavior of the students than before, constantly glancing around the Hall, but today at supper, Snape realized that it was the Gryffindor table, the spot where Potter and his friends sat, that attracted most of Slughorn's attention. And Potter was watching...

Snape's eyes darted to his left in time to catch a look between Potter and Dumbledore that set him seething again. \emph{There's something between them that involves Slughorn. I... I told Dumbledore that the Dark Lord was interested in Slughorn, but it's Potter that Dumbledore entrusts with his confidences! How much more is he keeping from me? How much is he telling Potter about me? Is this why Potter is so belligerent, so defiant this year? Because Dumbledore tells him everything!}

As soon as supper was over, Snape headed out of the castle and down to the lake shore to try to calm down.

About fifteen minutes later, the very obvious sound of someone moving through the fringe of trees let Snape know he'd been followed. He sent another stone skipping across the water, not needing to turn around to know it was Dumbledore.

"I would be delighted if you could teach me to do that. I do not believe I have ever seen another wizard make rocks bounce on the water like that."

"Lily taught me. It's a muggle skill. Haven't I told you that before? Besides, Hagrid can do it."

"Perhaps. Some things skip my mind. Come, walk with me nearer to the forest where we cannot be seen from the castle."

There were things Snape wanted to say, but the thing that burst from him was not what he'd planned. "What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you're closeted together?'

"I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late. Information for him to do what he needs to do."

"You trust him more than you trust me."

"Let us say I prefer not to put all my secrets in one basket. Especially a basket that dangles on Riddle's arm." Dumbledore raised a hand at Snape's protest. "I do not underestimate the constant danger you are in, Severus. Considering the risks, I trust you with more than I would ever trust anyone else."

"But Potter? Incapable of Occlumency, a mediocre magician who has a direct connection to the Dark Lord's mind..."

"Riddle has had a taste of what truly sharing Harry's mind means. He will not try to possess Harry again. His soul cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry's. Like a tongue on frozen steel. Like flesh in flame..."

Snape turned away from Dumbledore, trying to force the image of Potter's arrogant, sneering face from intruding into his mind. "We were talking of minds, not souls."

"In the case of Harry and Riddle, to speak of one is to speak of the other."

Snape didn't respond, nor did he turn to see the pitying look in Dumbledore's eyes.

"But it was not of their souls that I came to talk to you, Severus. It was yours. I have deliberated, and it seems to me that in some things you are right."

"I'm astounded. Overwhelmed."

"Do not be cheeky, or I shall subtract points from your house. I have considered that there are some circumstances in which it might be better to leave Draco's task unfulfilled. I have also considered your accusation that I do not care about the state of your soul, and found it to be inaccurate. I care very much. I do not think the splitting of a soul is at issue here."

"I would dearly like to know your reasoning about that, since it's my soul we're talking about."

"I believe that the state of the soul at the time of killing is of vital importance. It is the intent, the malice, that splits the soul. Thus, if the killing is done without malice, at the request of the victim for example, then the soul is not split."

"And I would have no problem about your acting in accordance with that belief if it were your soul we were talking about. Since it's mine, however, permit me to be skeptical."

"I think we should prepare for a variety of scenarios. There is always the possibility, for instance, that I may die first of the curse that still infects my hand, thus negating the Vow entirely. Under those circumstances you would, of course, look after Draco."

"Of course. Though it's looking more and more as if the curse is waning."

Dumbledore ignored the observation. "I should like you to investigate certain other things for me. Do not look at me like that - it has nothing to do with Gaunts or Peverells. I should like you, in the privacy of your own home, to investigate spells involving resurrection or resuscitation..."

"You're not fooling me like this! Not this easily! There is no such thing as a spell that resurrects from the dead, and I'm not killing you on your assurance that there is!"

"Shh. Keep your voice down please, Severus. I also want you to investigate any and all spells and potions that mimic death. Anything, in short, that would help us fool Riddle into believing his wishes had been carried out. And I mean for Malfoy as well as for me. Remember Emmeline Vance."

"But if both of you survive, what of the Vow?"

Dumbledore peered at Snape over his glasses. "You yourself said you preferred the idea of your death due to the Vow to my death due to your action. Are you backing down?" When Snape didn't answer, he continued. "Of course, these cannot be the only scenarios. You must also agree that if the situation warrants, and my death is truly required, you will abide by my assessment of the circumstances and do as I request."

Snape spun on Dumbledore in fury. "Now the truth comes out! This was all a blind to lead me by the nose back to the same old solution. Forget the near-death potions and the resuscitation spells! What we really want is for gullible old Snape to agree to kill you when you ask him to! Because gullible old Snape always does what Dumbledore asks! Well maybe you take too much for granted. Maybe I don't want to do it anymore! Maybe this obedient little donkey has finally been given too much, and he's going to kick over the traces! Get someone else to do your work!"

"You will not speak to me in that tone. I am asking nothing new. You have already consented, or have you forgotten? You gave me your word, Severus!"

When Snape refused to answer, allowing the mutiny in his heart to reflect on his face, Dumbledore sighed. "Come to my office tonight at eleven, Severus. You will never again complain that I have no confidence in you."

It was a confidence Snape would have given anything not to share. He listened in horror as Dumbledore, eyes closed as if to shut light from the dark truth, told him that a fragment of the Dark Lord lodged in Potter - that Potter was a horcrux that would have to be destroyed if the Dark Lord was to be defeated. By the time Dumbledore opened his eyes again, Snape had reached critical mass.

"You've kept him alive only so he can die at the right moment!"

"Don't act so shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you already watched die?"

It was a viciously low blow, and Snape's voice turned to ice in reply. "Lately, only those I couldn't save." He rose. He was already facing the door. "You used me!"

"Meaning?"

"I've spied for you, lied for you, gone into mortal danger for you, all to keep Lily's son alive... I believed it was for Lily! But you! You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter!"

Striding forward, Snape left the office without another word, slamming the door behind him with all the force in his body.

Snape stood poised at the top of the narrow path that led along the cliff face to the lake's edge and Lily's rock, with no recollection of his descent down the staircases of Hogwarts or his passage out through the great oaken doors into the night. Automatically he stepped forward onto the path, then stopped, rage throbbing in his veins with the savage beat of his pounding heart. He didn't want to talk to Lily. The last thing at that moment that he wanted to do was talk to Lily. He wanted... he wanted to smash Dumbledore's face into a brick wall and scrape the smirk off it. He wanted to tear Hogwarts down, stone by stone with his bare hands He wanted to wipe the entire wizarding world off the face of the earth with one cataclysmic spell...

Turning his back, literally and figuratively, on Hogwarts castle, Snape sped down the hill toward the gate, miraculously keeping his feet on the narrow road in the darkness. The gate with its boar guardians was the doorway to freedom, but it was his jailor, too. Snape didn't care. Not slowing his pace, he threw himself against the bars and, to his surprise, it opened and released him into Hogsmeade.

It was only at that moment that the fury burning in Snape began to reform itself into thought, for he glanced back over his shoulder at the towers of the castle where the light still glowed in Dumbledore's office.

So, you're going to let me out... let me run wild a bit... let me work through it and calm down... Snape's wand slipped from his sleeve into his hand and he raised it in defiance, sending a tightly focused pulse straight at the light, and felt a bitter satisfaction when the faraway pane shattered at the blow.

\emph{Take care the next time you ask me to kill you, you evil, sadistic, manipulative old ogre. You're going to get your wish.} Snape looked around at the quiet village and disapparated.

Wind and rain lashed the cliffs of Cornwall and whipped the sea into a froth far below where the water pounded against the rocks. Snape stood there, feet on the very edge of stone, the gale tearing at his hair and clothing, stinging his face with salt spray, and stared down into the turmoil of earth, air, and water, where they came together with such violence. If a bolt of lightning had struck at that moment, adding fire to its sister elements, he would have flung himself from the pinnacle to join them, with no Hagrid behind this time to pull him back from the brink.

Guilt had come full circle. At nineteen, afraid of pain, afraid of death, he'd bought his own life with a few repeated words whose import was unknown to him, and had thereby destroyed the sole thing he had left to treasure. Life had ended that October night, but he'd been spared to fulfill a duty, a duty he'd accepted as the only road to salvation that remained, to preserve the one piece of Lily that hadn't died - James Potter's son. To fulfill that duty he'd accepted the pain, accepted the constant companionship of death, accepted the submergence of his own will into that of Dumbledore, and for what? So that now that remaining piece of Lily could die, too. Die at Dumbledore's whim and for Dumbledore's purposes. And it was his, Snape's, fault. All his fault. Punishment had crouched waiting for him for over fifteen years. And Dumbledore had known all along. Had known and watched and laughed all those years. Gullible old Snape. Dumbledore's little donkey.

Snape hated Dumbledore with every fiber of his being.

But what if Dumbledore was thwarted? What if he wagered on the dumb donkey's obedience and was himself fooled? Snape could take Lily's Potter son and spirit him away where neither Dumbledore nor the Dark Lord would ever find the boy. Remove him from the game. Let the two power-mad sorcerers finish the war between them with no help from the donkeys or the swine...

There swam before Snape's inner vision the image of the Dark Lord's serpentine face and crimson eyes. No, that was not the way. To preserve Harry was to preserve the Dark Lord. No matter how desperately Snape tried to stave off the inevitable, it could not be escaped. There was no salvation. There had never been the possibility of salvation. All of it ashes, ashes strewn by the wind.

With a sigh that was also a sob, Snape accepted the inevitable and gazed in longing at the beckoning rocks.

That was when the new road opened before him. He blinked, then blinked again. There was something he could snatch from destruction, something he could cheat the Dark Lord of, and not because of Dumbledore. Because he himself wanted to do it. He could save Draco. The Snow Queen's son. Narcissa's boy.

It was only a straw, but Snape grasped it. Grasped it and returned with it to Hogwarts where for all of Friday he steadfastly refused to look at Dumbledore. He had been deprived of one hope, he would seize another. No matter what fate demanded of Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy would be spared.

Friday evening at headquarters might have been quite pleasant. Bella was not there, nor did the Dark Lord wish an interview. Snape was left alone with peacefully bubbling cauldrons and the calm precision of chemistry. He himself was neither peaceful nor calm.

\emph{He doesn't care what happens to me. All that hogwash about not losing me to the Vow was a con game. I tell him I'll be punished for usurping Draco's task, and he doesn't care. He's going to force me to defy the Dark Lord's wishes and remove himself as my protector at the same time. At the very least, the Dark Lord will believe I'm more loyal to Malfoy than to him. Narcissa will be in trouble, too. Would Bella risk her neck for me? No. Would she risk her neck for Narcissa and Draco? Maybe. What if Bella is already targeted for destruction like Draco? Probably not. She had nothing to do with losing the diary.}

\emph{Insurmountable problem number one is the dark mark. If I run, he can summon me, he can punish me, he can find me. How can I remove the mark from my arm? From Draco's arm, too. Even if Draco resists.}

Snape removed his jacket, rolled up the sleeve, and examined the brand. Just defacing it wouldn't be enough. It would have to be cut or burned out. \emph{I wonder how deeply it penetrates into the flesh? What if the only way to get rid of it is to amputate the arm?}

Rolling the sleeve back down, Snape returned to his work, carefully and steadily decanting a batch of newly made Wakefulness Potion into small bottles that could be carried in a pocket.

\emph{Where would I go? I'd have to take Narcissa - I couldn't leave her to face the Dark Lord alone. He'd send operatives to my home and the Malfoy mansion before anything else. The amount of time we'd have before that would be minimal. And neither Narcissa nor Draco would want to go. They wouldn't believe me. I'd have to stun them.}

\emph{Get Narcissa. Go somewhere to remove the dark marks. Go to a preplanned safe house. With two angry and hostile wizards. Dumbledore's the classic chief executive. All grandiose ideas but none of the logistics of making it work. Can't he see how much easier it would be just to keep Draco and Narcissa at Hogwarts? But then he'd have to be alive.}

\emph{This might be easier if I had someone here at headquarters...}

Snape finished up with his potions, put on his jacket, and went to the cafeteria. Yaxley was sitting at a table by a window reading \emph{The Daily Prophet}. Snape casually walked over but didn't sit down.

"Have you eaten yet?" Snape asked.

"No. Want to join me?"

"Ever try fish and chips and a pint in a pub?"

Yaxley glanced around, but no one was watching or listening to them. Then he looked up at Snape and mouthed the word `Muggles?'

"You have to know the enemy."

"I'm game. Food here's tasteless anyway. Lead on."

After giving Yaxley the appropriate muggle clothing, the two left headquarters into the chill of Friday evening in working class Birmingham on the last day of February. Normally Snape would have looked for something a bit more upscale, but with Yaxley he was quite willing to brave rowdy neighborhood pubs. Yaxley looked like a prizefighter, massive, fierce, and brutal, and he was the type who'd love the noise and atmosphere, and maybe even a fist fight.

The two found a likely place with a free booth in a corner, where they ordered muggle food and beer. A group on the other side of the room had a dart game going, and the level of noise from talking was so high that Snape and Yaxley had to raise their voices just to hear each other.

"Actually, I wanted to talk to you because I need backup. I'll be honest. Knowing about this could get you into trouble, so I can't tell you everything. I have a task, but I can't guarantee I'll be in the right place at the right time to do it. Being at Hogwarts all the time makes it harder. If I had someone helping me prepare, and covering for me without looking like he was covering for me, it would make things easier. If you don't want to hear any more, just say so and I stop now."

Yaxley shoveled another bite of food into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully. "Sounds interesting," he said after a moment.

Snape took a deep breath. "It involves Lucius's son Draco, and when it happens we may be moving fast."

After their talk, and considerably more food for Yaxley, who turned out to love fish and chips as much as Snape had as a boy, the two departed Birmingham for their own homes. Snape needed to start his new line of research for Dumbledore, and also work on a safe place to hide from the Dark Lord should it come to that. Yaxley was checking into short-term safe spots, Snape not having told him that going underground might be permanent.

One of Snape's first decisions was that any place of long-term refuge would have to be outside Britain. He himself had been to northern France and Holland, but no farther. The Dark Lord had been as far as Albania. But the Dark Lord had a very insular, Eurocentric mentality. There were places in the world he would simply not think of.

Australia, for example. Or most of Latin America. The fact that Draco and Narcissa were so clearly of northern European extraction did limit Snape's choices. They couldn't go anywhere where they would stand out and be noticeable. Snape's dark coloring might be able to pass for a variety of nationalities, but not the icy blondness of the Malfoys.

\emph{Canada? The United States? Uruguay? South Africa? Siberia? New Zealand? I suppose we'd have to go somewhere where they speak English. I really can't imagine Narcissa learning Spanish... And a large metropolitan area - somewhere easy to get lost in a crowd. How could I keep Draco away from a local wizarding community?} The longer Snape thought about it, the more hopeless the problem seemed.

The next morning he started thinking about it again. Large cities in other parts of the world... \emph{New York is out. If he ever thinks of America, it'll be of New York. Toronto or Minneapolis... Could we take the cold winters? Better that than too much heat. Seattle or Vancouver... maybe. I don't really know very much about them.}

Then Snape reached a point where he was telling himself the whole thing was pointless anyway since they'd never survive long enough to get out of Britain. That was when he started looking for resuscitation spells.

By mid-afternoon, having had quite enough research for one day, Snape returned to Hogwarts - to a Hogwarts that was fluttering with the news that Ron Weasley had nearly died from drinking poisoned wine.

"And where were you, I'd like to know?" McGonagall demanded. "You might have been of some use helping the poor boy."

"From what I understand, Minerva, the most important step was taken by Potter before anyone could be notified. Though how that boy thought to use a bezoar, much less knew where to find one at that moment, is beyond me. Besides, it was ordinary poison, meaning it wasn't some dark, cursed thing. Madam Pomfrey is at least as capable as I am in dealing with poison cases."

Talking to Dumbledore later, Snape was more interested in a different aspect of the case. "That was the second attempt the Dark Lord referred to. He must have been expecting to hear of your demise on Christmas Day after having partaken of your gift."

"It would so seem. I understand why Draco continues to attack me, but I deeply regret that these deadly presents continue to wind up in the hands of students. "

"We could just incarcerate him and keep him incommunicado."

"Which would result in Draco's failure and the invoking of your Vow. No, Draco is not actually attacking the students. He is trying to attack me. Maybe I should make myself more available to him."

"Maybe we could send the two of you to a desert island and let you duke it out there."

"Duke it out?"

"Fisticuffs. Your reach being so much longer than Draco's, it'd be a sure thing."

"You are not taking this seriously enough."

"Sir, with all due respect, maybe you're not taking it seriously enough. Draco could actually kill someone. He's almost done it twice now."

"It is a quandary. The Heads of Houses will have to instruct their students to be especially vigilant, and perhaps there should be a ban on gift-giving as well, as we have no way of knowing who may be placed under an Imperius curse next."

Snape rose to leave the office.

"By the way, Severus, have you managed to find out anything on those other topics."

"Winters in Seattle are warmer than winters in Minneapolis."

"I beg your pardon."

"Vancouver might be nice. I'm also thinking about Vancouver. That's assuming we survive the crossing of the Atlantic."

"Hmmm. Well, do what you can."

"Yes, sir."

The next day was Sunday, a day of leisurely mornings and long conversations. Snape contrived to sit beside Slughorn at breakfast.

"I hear you were instrumental in saving young Weasley from death, Professor. Wasn't it your bezoar that arrested the initial penetration of the poison?"

"Well, that's right! It was my bezoar! Though I give young Harry full credit for remembering I might be carrying it. It was my bezoar."

"I was away from the school that day, so I'm afraid I missed a lot. How did he know you were carrying a bezoar?"

"Well, he brought it up himself in Potions the first of the year. We were doing Golpalott's Third Law and Harry produced a bezoar as the solution." Slughorn suddenly slapped Snape on the back in a hearty display of camaraderie that was not received in the same spirit it was given. "Gad, it made me feel young again! Do you know his mother pulled the identical stunt for the identical lesson! What an intuitive grasp of potions that girl had, and the boy's got it, too."

\emph{Except she didn't, professor. Oh, she was good, but she wasn't that good. That was the day we started talking again, when she couldn't make her antidotes, and I told her to show you a bezoar. But where would Potter get the same idea?}

Snape finished his breakfast as quickly as possible and hurried down to his office. The idea had flashed across his mind once before, at Slughorn's Christmas party with the mention of the Draught of Living Death, but then he'd been sidetracked. Now he checked cupboards, cabinets, and shelves, looking through stacks of manuals and recipe books, not finding what he was looking for.

At lunch Snape once again sought out Slughorn. "Did I leave some books in your room when I packed up? Manuals and things?"

"I don't think so. Just some used textbooks."

"Mind if I check?"

Slughorn unlocked the classroom door and waved lazily toward the cabinet. "Bottom shelf."

The book with its familiar cover was there. Snape didn't want to draw attention to it by taking it, since he had no reason to keep Potions texts in his office. Instead he moved the books aside as if looking for other things. "No one's been in here all year then?"

"No one. Had to loan out a couple of books to students who got Es on their OWLs, but they gave them back when they got their own copies."

Snape stared down at the book, then casually opened it. The half-century-old cover bound a brand new text. Someone had ripped the cover off the book to disguise the fact that he was using another student's notes to help him with his work. And Snape knew who the someone was. The one who'd read and followed the instruction Snape had written to his mother twenty years earlier: \emph{Just shove a bezoar down their throats.}

That left two problems, problems that Snape wrestled with for some time. First, of course, should he take the book away from Potter? But then Potter would know that it was his book and, considering Potter's attitude towards him and the fact that there were some nasty little curses in the margins, might start spreading tales. So far no one, to Snape's knowledge, had been lifted into the air with a Levicorpus, so it seemed Potter wasn't using the hexes. Snape decided to wait for an opportunity to take the book when his own connection to it would be less obvious.

The second problem was more of a mystery. Snape knew he'd checked that cabinet and every other cabinet when he moved out of the classroom. He hadn't been thinking of the book because he hadn't used it for so long, but if he'd seen it, he'd have taken it with him. It was, after all, his personal property, his mother's book, and something he wanted to stay out of Slughorn's hands. Why hadn't he seen it?

It had to be the Peculiaris spell. That would mean that the book was not Snape's property. \emph{The connection from my mother to me is clear. She gave it to me, and in any case when she died all her possessions became mine. Could she have purchased a used book, and the original owner is still considered to have possession? Or could it mean that in some way ownership has passed from me to someone else? Not necessarily Potter, since the Peculiaris spell was cast before it was loaned to him. To whom does the book belong?}

It was a question whose solution would have to wait for a while - one among many and by no means the most important.

The next weekend, Snape went down to Birmingham on the Friday again. This time Yaxley came looking for him.

"What else can you get in one of those pubs?"

"Traditional English food. Bangers and mash, steak and kidney pie, Yorkshire pudding. Nowadays they serve almost anything, so I suppose chicken Kiev and falafel, too."

"Good. I'm starved. What say we go out to eat?"

"You're going to have to wait. I've got a bundle of orders to fill that'll take me at least two hours."

"Anything I can help with?"

It was a question that had never occurred to Snape before, but he didn't see why not. Not having an idea of how capable Yaxley was with potions, Snape set him to some easy mixing at first. Yaxley turned out to be an acceptable potions maker. Not extraordinary, but acceptable.

"What's your regular job around here, anyway?" Snape asked as they were straightening up the mixing area, washing the beakers, and making sure the cauldrons were simmering properly.

Yaxley gave him a funny look. "You've got to be the least curious person at headquarters," he said. "Bella never could figure out why the Dark Lord wanted you to be his spy at Hogwarts. She can't imagine you hunting down bits of information."

"There's not a lot to learn at Hogwarts. It's chiefly keeping an eye on Dumbledore. Besides, I was wanted for the potions and spells. That's why they recruited me. The Hogwarts job was a bonus."

"Me - for my looks, I guess. I scare lots of people. I came in at the same time as a bunch of mates. All at once. Pledged ourselves on the same day. You'd 've been a kid in school still when that happened. Got my big chance at Cardiff, but didn't do such a good job. Now I float around, mostly supplies or helping out in personnel. I'd normally be out in the field, but Bella doesn't want me."

Snape nodded in understanding. If that was the case, he could use Yaxley with the potions, especially during the week. Maybe with defense training, too, if there was ever another class. As it was, his job today had taken a little over half the time he anticipated because of two pairs of hands.

While they finished up in the lab and got ready to leave, Snape's thoughts went back to his own initiation into the Death Eaters. \emph{If I'd known then what I know now, I wouldn't have been so eager to be a part of this `family.' It seems so long ago, pledging...}

'\emph{All I have and all I am are yours.'}

Snape stopped, stunned. Was that when it happened? Had he indeed given everything to the Dark Lord, including the copy of \emph{Advanced Potion Making}? The ramifications of that idea were astounding. It meant that the Dark Lord owned the possessions of every Death Eater in Britain, at least of every Death Eater who'd made that particular vow. It would include Snape's own home and Lucius Malfoy's mansion, and yet...

At no time had Snape ever heard that the Dark Lord laid claim to those things. It would never have occurred to Snape himself that the words could be taken literally had it not been for the episode with his book. Could it be, if it were true, that the Dark Lord was also unaware of the transfer that had taken place?

Filing the thought in the back of his mind, Snape left headquarters with Yaxley for a pleasant evening at the pub they'd visited the week before, where they discussed, among other things, possible locations for safe houses in Britain.

"This is a most interesting development, if true." Dumbledore leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers in front of his chest. "Are you sure?"

"That the few items in the classroom that I owned before I became a Death Eater became invisible to me after I performed the Peculiaris spell, but that things I acquired later did not? Reasonably sure. I haven't figured out a way to test it with other people's things, so at the moment it's just a hypothesis. I wouldn't want to check with mine using any kind of spell that might alert the Dark Lord. Which means at the moment it remains a hypothesis."

"We must study ways to use this to our advantage... You returned early. May I take it you did not go to your home in Lancashire?"

"I thought you might be interested in hearing about this right away."

"A correct assumption. May I suggest, however, that you go to Lancashire now? I do want you to work on that other research I requested, and you might experiment with your things in the house to see which of them vanish from your sight as well."

"If I'm right, it would pretty much be the whole house and everything in it. I don't have a lot there that's new."

"That would be a most amazing sight to see. I look forward to your description of it."

Snape departed Hogwarts immediately and spent the rest of the night and most of Saturday in Lancashire, with the result that he missed seeing Potter hit in the head with a Beater's bat by his own Keeper at the Quidditch match that day.

Instead of a Quidditch game, Snape spent part of Saturday looking into tetrodotoxins, saxitoxins, and a variety of other neurotoxins. The whole matter of simulating death was a fairly easy problem, requiring only great care in matching the minute amounts of poison to the general health and body mass of the `victim.'

Likewise resuscitation, the revival of the apparently dead, was a relatively easy process. One merely had to know the cause of the cataleptic or paralytic state and use the proper methods. The difficult part was resurrection, the revival of one actually dead.

Most of the texts in Snape's possession agreed that it was impossible to resurrect the dead. Just one reference contradicted this consensus, citing a spell that could only be cast by the person responsible for the death and claiming to have been successful in 50\% of the cases. The major drawback was that in 100\% of the half dozen recorded attempts to cast this spell, the spell caster had died. \emph{I think I won't even mention this one to Dumbledore. He'd be sure to try to talk me into it.}

The following weekend, Snape went to Birmingham on the Sunday evening and had the unpleasant experience of running into Bella Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback at the entrance to headquarters.

"Why puppy dog! How lovely to see you! I see your little shield is working nicely."

"It is indeed, Bellatrix. Were you trying to break in again?"

"You're mistaking me for some of Dumbledore's people. He's the one who consorts with thieves, as we've just been mentioning to the Dark Lord. Birds of a feather, you know."

Snape thought about this as he went to check the week's list of requisitions and was therefore not surprised to receive the summons to the interview chamber.

"You have access to the headquarters of Dumbledore's Order."

"Only if I'm called to a meeting, Lord. Though I can go to the place, I have no keys or spells to unlock the doors. I have to be admitted."

"This is unfortunate. Still, it may be a minor point. One of the Order has been stealing the possessions of the Black family. Do you know who it is?"

Not wanting the Dark Lord to know that he had the answer prepared, Snape paused as if to reflect. "There is only one I can think of, Lord. One member of the Order is, in fact, a petty thief and fencer of stolen goods. His name is Mundungus Fletcher."

"You may return to your work."

Yaxley was in the cafeteria where Greyback and the Carrows had opened a bottle of firewhisky and were becoming obnoxious.

"Just think," Greyback was howling, "a whole generation of little wolflings to do the Lord's bidding! Where's the best place to `recruit' them? Where do they congregate in a mass? Hey, Professor! How many little recruits you got up there in Scotland? If I get my work done down here before next weekend, I may pop up north and check them out!"

"Do you want to go out for a pint?" Snape asked Yaxley quietly. "The atmosphere here is less than wholesome."

"I'm with you."

The clerk at the sign-in table was used by now to seeing the two leave for the pub. "Enjoy your evening," he said automatically.

Once in the pub, Snape waited a decent amount of time, then excused himself to go to the men's room. There he opened the small window and released a patronus with a message for Dumbledore: \emph{Get Mundungus Fletcher somewhere safe. The Dark Lord is looking for him and possibly for anyone who purchased things from him.}

Snape then returned to the booth and spent the next hour discussing safe houses with Yaxley. They were narrowing it down to York, Sheffield, or Oxford.

"What do you mean, the students are going to Hogsmeade next Sunday? It's the full moon. What if Greyback does attack?"

"Now Severus, it is only the sixth years who will be seventeen before the apparition tests on the twenty-first of next month. Do not worry, they will be well guarded and will be back on the grounds before moonrise. By the way, have you seen this morning's \emph{Prophet}? Your work is mentioned in it."

Taking the newspaper from Dumbledore, Snape scanned it quickly. At first he saw nothing, then noticed the article that said Mundungus Fletcher had been arrested. "That was fast."

"I try not to waste time when Riddle is looking for someone. I wish I knew why he targeted Octavius Pepper."

"Who is Pepper?" Snape looked at the paper again. "Why would they take him?"

"I was hoping you could tell me. He isn't anyone very important. Adequate in his studies, but no more."

"If I hear anything, I'll tell you. I have a class now."

"Thank you, Severus."

The last student into the class by a measurable amount of time was Potter, who burst through the door and rushed to his desk drawing all eyes to him in the back of the room. \emph{Probably his intention.}

"Late again, Potter? Ten points from Gryffindor." \emph{More if I manage to catch you with my book.} "Before we start, I want your dementor essays..." Snape collected them with a wave of his wand. "And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now if you will all open your books to page... What is it, Mr. Finnigan?"

Finnigan lowered the hand he'd been wildly waving in the air. "Sir, I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius..."

\emph{I do not want to think about Mundungus Fletcher this morning. I do not want to think about anyone who forces me to send off a patronus two blocks from headquarters...} "No, there wasn't."

"But sir, I heard people talking..."

"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher."

Potter immediately began whispering to Weasley and Granger, probably about Fletcher. \emph{If one of the other students overhears what they're saying and realizes they all know Fletcher it could compromise the Order. Has that boy no sense at all?} Snape cut the conversation short. "But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject. Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost."

Caught off guard, Potter stammered, "Er... well... ghosts are transparent..."

Snape cringed slightly, then took a deep breath. "Oh, very good. Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. Ghosts are transparent." This from the boy who took an Outstanding in his Dark Arts OWL.

Potter plunged ahead. "Yeah. Ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren't they? So they'd be solid..."

"A five-year-old could have told us as much. The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells, transparent."

Then Weasley broke into the exchange with another distillation of wisdom. "Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart! When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a shufti to see if it's solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, `Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'"

\emph{A determination one could make in a fraction of a second, but you didn't say that to add information, you said it to get a laugh. Laugh at this...} "Another ten points from Gryffindor. I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot apparate half an inch across a room. Now open your books to page two hundred thirteen and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus curse..."

The rest of the class was focused and on task, neither Potter nor Weasley apparently willing to make greater fools of themselves than they already had.

As it turned out, there was no trouble the following Sunday when the older sixth year students went to Hogsmeade for their extra apparation lessons. Snape had gone to Birmingham on Friday and returned on Saturday just to be available as a chaperone, but he needn't have bothered. The day was, in fact, completely uneventful.

The following week was hectic as students wrapped up reports and projects for the term, and then it was the Easter break, and the school emptied, students scattering to all corners of Britain to pass the next three weeks with their families.

Snape got permission from Dumbledore to spend more time during the break at his home or in Birmingham, one of the things he wanted to do being to set up the safe house with Yaxley. They decided on Oxford as so full of tourists, students, and professors, many of whom might be wearing academic robes at any time, that he and Malfoy would be less conspicuous should they have to run quickly with no time to prepare.

They found a tiny apartment in the upper rear of a nineteenth century brick building on Cornmarket Street. Mind spells made it easy to lease the two small rooms, after which Snape and Yaxley shielded them as they'd done with the laboratory.

A couple of beds, a table, some chairs, tins and boxes of nonperishable food, a hot plate, dishes and utensils were all the furnishing the place needed. Snape then began moving in certain tools, including some basic potions ingredients and equipment, medicines, bandages, a set of surgical knives, and a small brazier with charcoal and a pair of instruments that resembled branding irons.

These last caused Yaxley to raise his eyebrows. "Looks like you're planning a party," was all he said.

They roamed Oxford for a few days, giving Snape the chance to visit Blackwell's bookstore as well as a couple of places that specialized in rare books, one of which was clearly run by an old wizard who treated them very well the moment he sniffed out that they weren't muggles.

Yaxley had never been to Oxford before, so Snape kindly played the role of tour guide, and generally played it straight - except for managing to convince Yaxley that Martyrs' Memorial really was the spire of an underground church that happened to stick up out of the pavement due to an earthquake. Since that was the only joke he played, Snape felt he'd been rather restrained and that he deserved his very own martyr's crown.

Before they left Oxford, Snape and Yaxley experimented with apparating into the new safe house. They had no problem, but Snape was worried about traveling with Draco. He told Yaxley that he might send down a tissue sample for DNA analysis, and Yaxley promised to adjust the shields.

All in all, it was an extremely pleasant week. The rest of Snape's time at headquarters was spent working on potions, conducting a small self-defense class to train some of Bella's new people, and in general avoiding Bella and Greyback. Reports were coming in of attacks, especially on children, that Snape found highly disturbing.

Meanwhile, Snape continued his research and amassed an impressive collection of potions and spells that would mimic death and aid in the resuscitation of a person near death or in a comatose or paralyzed state. He'd still found no other resurrection spells.

Dumbledore also went through a series of scenarios in which simultaneous spells might be cast, one verbal and one nonverbal. The fact that the Unforgivable curses had little or no power if said without intent aided this scheming immensely.

As soon as the Easter break ended, the older sixth years took their apparation tests. Granger passed hers, one of the few to do so on the first try. Neither Malfoy nor Potter was old enough to take the test.

For the next couple of weeks everything moved so smoothly that Snape was beginning to wonder if all the worries of the previous months had been for nothing. There was no further attempt by Malfoy on Dumbledore's life, nor very much of an attempt at anything, truth be told. The boy kept to himself most of the time. Headquarters was quiet, and the students at Hogwarts were beginning to realize that there were less than six weeks to go before exams. The fifth and seventh years were madly studying for OWLs and NEWTs, and Hogwarts basked in peace.

It was therefore a total shock to be leaving Dumbledore's office by the seventh-floor exit in the middle of the second week in May and hear from the floor below the sound of a girl's voice screaming, "Murder! Murder in the bathroom! Murder!"

It took but a few seconds for Snape to reach the sixth floor bathroom. What he encountered there was horrific.

There was blood everywhere. In the midst of a pool of blood and water, Malfoy lay on his back in shock, his body quivering as his hands struggled feebly to staunch the flow of blood from massive gashes in his face and chest. Potter knelt next to him, spattered with Malfoy's blood, himself too panicky to do anything but stare.

Snape knew the spell, the curse he'd invented himself and then retreated from when he witnessed its effect on bushes and a tree. He'd never used it against another human being until he'd learned to control it with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel, and he'd never taught it to anyone. Now Potter had pulled Sectumsempra from a book that should not have left the bottom shelf of its cabinet, and Malfoy was dying.

His reaction the immediate one of a natural healer - take care of what most needs care - Snape pushed Potter aside without a thought and knelt beside Malfoy, his wand already in his hand. Quickly he began one of the chants his grandmother had taught him so many years ago. The blood began to clot, and its flow was stemmed.

His body rocking slightly to the rhythm of the chant, Snape projected some of his own energy, his own life force, into the knitting of sliced tissue, and the terrible gashes began to heal. Only then did Snape wipe some of the blood from Malfoy's face, concerned about the degree of shock the boy might suffer if he became aware enough to register the quantity of blood.

Another sequence of chanting, and Malfoy was whole enough to move. \emph{I have to get him out of here, out before he looks around and realizes that this is his own blood.} Speaking in a low, soothing, matter-of-fact tone, he murmured, "You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that... Come..."

On his feet now, Malfoy was able to walk to the door. Only then did Snape remember the other boy, the one who was not slashed and bleeding. Turning at the door, he tried to control the fury in his voice as he said, "And you, Potter... You wait here for me."

Downstairs in the hospital wing, Snape tried to convey to Madam Pomfrey the seriousness of Malfoy's loss of blood without dwelling too much on the viciousness of the attack or the identity of the attacker. Luckily the two of them had a professional relationship of deep mutual trust, and she accepted that he had sound reasons for not going into detail.

Snape then returned to the sixth floor bathroom, where Potter was still waiting for him, though he'd expected nothing less. The ghost whose screams had alerted him was still there, now obviously enjoying the situation. "Go," Snape told her, and she left.

"I didn't mean it to happen," Potter protested at once. "I didn't know what that spell did."

\emph{An Outstanding in Dark Arts, and he blindly uses spells of whose effects he is ignorant. What does this boy use for brains? Well, Mr. Potter, it so happens I know where you got that one.} "Apparently I underestimated you, Potter. Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?" \emph{Careful, Severus. This has to develop naturally. Gad! Why didn't I take that book away from him at once?}

"I... read about it somewhere."

"Where?" \emph{Should I be pleased or angry that your ability to lie is so pathetic? What happens if you face the Dark Lord?}

"It was... a library book. I can't remember what it was call..."

"Liar." Potter had given him the excuse he needed, and both of them knew what would happen next. Snape focused on Potter's mind and called for books. The image of the sixth year text swam to the surface of Potter's thoughts with an ease that was discouraging. \emph{I worked with you for weeks on this and you can't hide the title of a book from me for thirty seconds? What a waste of time.}

The green eyes stared back into Snape's and this time they were not Lily's eyes, and it was not James's face. It was Harry's face and Harry's eyes, and Harry had been stupid enough to nearly kill a schoolmate because of carelessness that would shame a first year student.

"Bring my your schoolbag," Snape ordered in disgust, "and all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now."

Potter returned gasping for breath as if he'd been running, and yet the amount of time he'd taken to go up one floor to Gryffindor Tower, up to his dormitory, and back down was what he'd need to calmly walk the distance. Snape already knew something was wrong before he silently held out his hand and received the schoolbag.

Each book was taken out and examined in silence, and in all that time Potter never once asked how Malfoy was. The last book was the Potions text with its deceptively new cover. Snape examined the outside, opened the cover, and flipped through the pages. It was, in fact, a new text - not his old book at all.

"This is your copy of \emph{Advanced Potion-Making}, is it, Potter?"

"Yes."

"You're quite sure of that, are you, Potter?"

"Yes."

"This is the copy of \emph{Advanced Potion-Making} that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?"

"Yes."

\emph{I have given you three opportunities to tell the truth. You have refused all of them.} "Then why does it have the name `Roonil Wazlib' written inside the front cover?"

The boy brazened it out to the end. "That's my nickname."

"Your nickname."

"Yeah... that's what my friends call me."

"I understand what a nickname is." Snape didn't really need to make eye contact to guess that R. W. was Ronald Weasley under any misspelling of the name, but he drew a fleeting image out of Potter anyway so that there would be no doubt between the two of them. Then Potter looked away.

"Do you know what I think, Potter?" said Snape after a pause. "I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of the term. What do you think, Potter?"

Potter continued to look down. "I... I don't agree, sir."

\emph{So now, facing punishment, you finally condescend to call me `sir.'} "Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions. Ten o'clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office."

"But sir... Quidditch... the last match of the..."

\emph{James surfaces at last. You cheat your way through the whole school year, seriously injure another student, about whom you have yet to inquire, nearly commit murder, and all is to be forgiven because you play Quidditch... Not this time.} Snape's voice became even more quiet. "Ten o'clock. Poor Gryffindor... fourth place this year, I fear..." \emph{Which will teach you to place a sport above the life and health of another person.}

Leaving Potter in the bathroom, Snape went immediately to McGonagall's office to inform her that he'd imposed detention on one of her students and why. She was horrified. "Is the boy all right?" was her instant reaction.

"He'll be fine. Another minute or two and he wouldn't have been. That's the truly frightening part, and Potter doesn't seem to get it. No one else came near that bathroom all the time I was there. No one else would have heard that ghost screaming. If I'd left Dumbledore's office five minutes earlier or later - Draco'd have died. Potter doesn't care."

"Well, he'll be hearing from me, and then he'll care. And you'd better get cleaned up or you'll be frightening the students."

Snape looked down at his robes and realized that they were soaked with drying, crusted blood from where he'd knelt to heal Malfoy. With a tired sigh he rose and left McGonagall to go downstairs to the dungeons and his office. He met no one on the way, since the whole school was now at supper.

It was only after he was alone that it came to him. He didn't have to invent a reason to collect a tissue sample from Draco for the DNA analysis. Very carefully, Snape scraped fragments of the crusted blood into a vial, labeled it for Yaxley, and sent it by owl to Birmingham to help calibrate the shields of the safe house in Oxford.

Snape and McGonagall went together to speak to Dumbledore, who'd already received Madam Pomfrey's report. Malfoy was on his way to a complete recovery, so the main problem was now Potter.

"I don't know where he could have gotten a spell like that," McGonagall insisted. "There's nothing like it in any book in the school."

"I would not say that, Minerva. There are many cutting spells that are mildly similar. I will agree that I have not before seen one quite so ruthless in its operation."

Taking a deep breath, Snape said, "He got it from me." He then went on to explain all about his mother's Potions book.

Dumbledore peered over his glasses. "I do not recall any student during your years here who was rushed to Madam Pomfrey bleeding to death."

"I never used it on anyone. Not at full strength. I tried it on a sapling and destroyed it. Then I spent months learning how to control it."

"And where is this book now."

Snape and McGonagall looked at each other. "We don't know," she admitted. "He's hidden it. But Headmaster, what is most distressing is that Potter shows no remorse for his deed. He hasn't expressed any concern about Malfoy at all. Not to me at any rate."

"This is gravely disturbing to me as well. There may at the moment be other pressures affecting Harry that impair his moral judgment. We must gently coax him to an understanding of the seriousness of his action. Meanwhile," Dumbledore peered at Snape again, "there is a book somewhere in this castle containing every spell, jinx, curse, and hex you ever cast as a student. If I should mention it to Professor Flitwick, he would not rest until he found it. That knowledge has been a dream of his for two decades."

McGonagall teased Snape with the specter of an inquisitive Flitwick all the way down seven flights of stairs until she finally left him for her own office.

The first and foremost advantage of having Potter do detention from midmorning to mid-afternoon on Saturday was that Snape had an excuse not to attend the Quidditch match. Beyond that, he was at first at a loss as to what task to assign Potter. There were, unfortunately, no Potions materials that needed cleaning or sorting.

It was Filch who approached Snape, the story of Potter's transgression having spread quickly through the school. While all of the teachers sympathized with Snape and commiserated with him on having to deal with a traumatic situation, Filch actually came forward with work that needed to be done.

What it amounted to was school archives. Filch was responsible for keeping a file on student misdemeanors and punishments, and someone had to go through the boxes being sure that all the carefully lettered cards were still legible and in good condition.

It was a treasure trove. Snape spent a whole evening perusing the cards in one box, remembering when Evan Rosier had sprayed the Ravenclaw table with toad spawn in retaliation for having been locked in a broom closet on the morning of an important Charms presentation, or when Rabastan Lestrange had booby trapped a flagstone in front of the entrance to Hufflepuff house after the Hufflepuffs had celebrated a Quidditch victory by scrawling lewd graffiti all over the outer walls of Slytherin. It made Snape feel young again.

Interestingly enough, his own name appeared seldom, and then for minor infractions. Snape attributed this to the fact that he was always retaliating, never initiating, that he took special precautions to cover his tracks, and that his own transgressions were usually overshadowed by the enormities of others.

Two names that appeared continually, though, were Sirius Black and James Potter. They were the ones who bounced Wilkes down three flights of stairs, and covered the entire surface of the Dark Arts room in treacle? As he read card after card, Snape wondered where the two of them ever found time to study.

It was a perfect assignment for Potter. Potter was just as full of himself as James had been, and just as careless of the rights of others. Potter might even improve if brought face to face with the crimes of his father and Sirius Black. Snape decided to start Potter on a box that he, Snape, had not looked at yet. The dust and cobwebs were evidence that the cards had not been tampered with, and Potter would have no choice but to accept the reality of his father's and godfather's characters.

For the next couple of weeks the world was normal. Outside the walls of Hogwarts, Bella's field operations team continued with dementor and werewolf attacks, but inside it was all OWLs, NEWTs, and end of term exams. Snape had no more planning he could do for Draco since he'd finally worked out an escape route that took him from Oxford to Wiltshire, and from there to Paris.

Everyone who ran from the Dark Lord went north. Snape would go the other direction, from Paris to Bordeaux, Madrid, Rabat, the Canaries, and the Cape Verde Islands. Then came the longest and most difficult jump across the Atlantic to Fortaleza on the Brazilian coast. From there in easy stages, through Brazil to Trinidad and the Caribbean Islands, to the United States. The final destination, at least for a while, was Denver, Colorado.

That was assuming they could get out of Britain, of course. Snape was still hoping it wouldn't be necessary, that Dumbledore would see the necessity of staying in charge.

Then, the first week in June, Dumbledore sent for Snape right after supper.

"I need you to be available tonight."

"Available?"

"Where someone can find you instantly. Preferably in your office."

"I don't understand." In reality it was more a question of not wanting to understand, for Dumbledore's request was sudden, and took Snape somewhat off guard.

"I have a task to perform tonight. I may be in need of assistance when I return. I do not know how late it will be. Expect something along the lines of what happened last July."

"Sir, could you at least tell me..."

"No, Severus, I am afraid I could not. There are things you should not know unless there are no alternatives. Be ready for any kind of dark spell or potion."

"You're walking into a trap. The Dark Lord..."

"Just be ready, Severus."

"Yes... Sir."

Back in his office, Snape pulled out books and ingredients, trying to foresee all eventualities and possibilities. Not knowing if the headmaster would be able to come all the way up the hill to the dungeon, he had a kit ready with those items most frequently used.

Then, as the twilight deepened, a thought flashed across his brain. Grabbing an item from a jar in a cabinet, he rushed up the stairs to Dumbledore's office, but the headmaster had already left. Inquiring of the Bloody Baron in the entry hall, Snape learned that he'd headed down to Hogsmeade, and that Potter was with him.

Returning to his office, Snape looked at the bezoar in his hand and cursed himself for not having thought of it earlier. \emph{Ah well. Maybe he won't need it.}

Then began the long wait. Once, around ten o'clock, he went out into the corridor for a bit of air and to move around a bit, and caught a glimpse of Granger and Lovegood, who for some reason were loitering in the passage and fled at his appearance, but otherwise Snape waited at his desk for the message that would tell him Dumbledore had returned.

Snape never got that message. Instead, around midnight, he got Professor Flitwick pounding on his office door and screaming, "Severus! Severus! Come at once! There are Death Eaters in the castle, Severus! Come at once!"

Snape flung open the office door, and Professor Flitwick practically fell into the room. "Upstairs, seventh floor, we need you up there," Flitwick gasped, and suddenly for Snape the world was moving in slow motion.

\emph{Flitwick! Why didn't we talk about the others? What if Dumbledore tells me to do something, and Flitwick tries to stop me? What if Flitwick is injured in the fighting? What if those silly girls outside are injured in the fighting? What if he tries to stop me from obeying Dumbledore?}

In a flash, Snape drew his wand and cast a Stupefying charm on Flitwick. Simple and crude, but highly effective.

Rushing out of the room, Snape ordered Granger and Lovegood inside his office to take care of Flitwick. Three birds with one stone. Then he ran for the entrance hall.

Seven flights of stairs. Snape was still young, but not that young. He forced himself to move, two steps at a time, though adrenaline surging into his system quickly made the physical exertion easier. \emph{Seventh floor! How could Death Eaters have made it to the seventh floor? How could they have made it into the castle?}

The chaos on the seventh floor registered briefly. A spell made the area dark and the people hard to see, but he recognized a few. \emph{Bella's people. Please don't let me find Bella here, too.} What struck Snape with the force of a blow was the shimmering of light at the staircase to the Astronomy Tower. \emph{It's been shielded. By Yaxley. What the hell is Yaxley doing here?}

McGonagall was there, Lupin, Tonks, the two Weasleys and Longbottom. Killing curses were ricocheting off the walls, propelled by field operatives, and Snape managed to deflect one that nearly hit both himself and the Weasley girl. Then he was at the staircase, through the shield, and heading to the top of the Astronomy Tower.

Just as he neared the door, Snape heard Greyback's harsh snarl.

"I'll do it."

"I said no!" Yaxley yelled, and there was the sound of a stunning spell.

"Draco!" screeched a woman's voice, Alecto Carrow's, "do it or stand aside so one of us..."

And then Snape was through the door and standing once again on the Astronomy Tower, gasping for breath and taking everything in - Dumbledore wilting against the far parapet, Malfoy right in front of him, two brooms - so Potter was surely there as well, wrapped in his invisibility cloak. To Snape's right were Greyback, Alecto and Amycus Carrow and... Yaxley. Snape stared at him for a second, until Dumbledore's voice recalled him.

"Severus..."

His gaze snapping instantly to Dumbledore, Snape shoved Malfoy aside to get better eye contact. Once again the messages passed with the speed of thought.

\emph{Do not speak. Listen. There was a trap. Take this memory. Analyze it later. Now get them out of the school. They will follow if they think you are with them. Appear to kill me. Throw me from the tower so they cannot examine my body. I shall do the rest.}

\emph{No! That will kill you!}

\emph{You swore. Obey me. Fenrir intends to attack the students. I want no more deaths. Throw me from the tower and get them out now! Protect Draco.}

\emph{No...}

\emph{Do not worry. I shall do the rest.}

Looking past Snape's right shoulder, Dumbledore suddenly spoke aloud. "Severus... please..."

Hating the Dark Lord, hating himself, hating Dumbledore, Snape raised his wand. \emph{"Avada Kedavra,"} he intoned, and as green flame left the wand he thought \emph{Levicorpus}. Even as the flame struck, Dumbledore's body was lifted into the air, hung suspended for a second then, with the nonverbal \emph{Liberacorpus,} plunged to the earth three hundred feet below.

The other Death Eaters stared at Snape in astonishment, shocked that the quiet lab technician could suddenly turn into a cold-blooded killer. Alecto's eyes were gleaming; she would follow him anywhere.

"Out of here, quickly," Snape commanded, seizing Malfoy and hustling him through the door and down the stairs without waiting to see whether the others followed. He knew they would. A wave of his wand and a silent command removed the shield.

Behind him feet clattered down the staircase. In front of him the fight still raged, but it was now clear that the Death Eaters controlled most of the area and were pushing the defenders back. The reinforcements from the tower would tip whatever balance was left unless Snape could make them break off the fight and leave.

"We have what we came for!" he yelled at them. "Merton! Wood! Head for the stairs. Greyback! Leave that and follow me! It's over, time to go!" Then, still pushing Malfoy ahead of him, Snape raced for the stairs himself. They had to get to where they could apparate. \emph{What if the defenses are still up? How do we get out?}

Down the stairs, out the door, past the form on the grass that Snape's brain refused to identify, across the lawn - Snape was tiring now, only fear spurring him forward. Figures sprinted past him in the night, whooping and yelling as Hagrid charged out of his hut to intercept them. Snape couldn't stop. His sole concern now was Malfoy.

As they ran for the perimeter, Snape pointed his wand and the heavy gates began to swing open. \emph{The defenses are down. Did Dumbledore do that now, or did he leave them open when he came in on the broom?} There was no time to ponder. Safety lay on the other side.

A sudden shaft of red light shot past Snape's head. Screaming, "Run, Draco!" Snape whirled to cover the boy's retreat - only to find himself face to face with Potter. \emph{Not you. Not you. Not now.}

Potter's mind was forming the Cruciatus curse - Snape knocked him down before he could say the word. Beyond Potter, Hagrid's hut burst into flames, illuminating the scene with a hellish, dancing light. Potter tried again, and again Snape saw the curse before Potter could say it and parried it with ease.

\emph{Fool! Why do you waste time with curses you don't know how to use? Fight your enemies with your strongest weapons, not your weakest!} "No Unforgivable curses from you, Potter! You haven't got the nerve or the ability..." A binding spell came next, and Snape blocked that one, too.

"Fight back!" Potter screamed. "Fight back, you cowardly..."

"Coward, did you call me, Potter? Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one - what would you call him, I wonder?"

Next came a stunning spell. Someone needed to teach Potter how to duel. "Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter." Silhouettes loomed against the lurid flames, forms Snape recognized as Merton and the Carrows. "Now come!" Snape yelled at them. "It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up..."

Yet Merton was not to be deflected. He hit Potter from behind with a Cruciatus curse, but as the boy fell writhing on the grass, Snape screamed, "No!" and blasted Merton's wand from his hand. "Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord... we are to leave him! Go! Go!"

Miraculously, they believed him and obeyed, thundering past toward the gate where Draco already waited on the edge of safety, unable to disapparate alone. Potter staggered to his feet, his face distorted with hatred. The spell that Snape tossed aside this time was Sectumsempra. Potter tried again - \emph{"Levi-"}

"No, Potter!" It was the spell used to throw Dumbledore from the tower. Slamming Potter with an Impedimenta, Snape advanced on the now wandless boy in rage. "You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them... I, the `Half-Blood Prince.' And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so."

Potter made a grab for his wand, but Snape saw it coming. "No," he said, and flipped the wand beyond reach.

The world was awash with darkness and flame, hell brought to life in a waking nightmare to torment the vision of souls already damned. In that nightmare, Severus Snape stared down at the darker mass that was the boy who had been the cause of all of this destruction.

"Kill me, then. Kill me like you killed him, you coward..." Potter yelled at him.

His once safe world shattered, his only refuge destroyed, torment and death waiting beyond the gate, Snape cracked. "Don't call me coward!" he screamed, and lashed out at Potter in fury.

What might have happened then he would never know, for Hagrid's hippogriff swooped down in Potter's defense, slashing at Snape's face and arm. Breaking away, Snape ran for the gate, grabbed Draco, and disapparated...
