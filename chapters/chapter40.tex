\subsection{Chapter 40: Chapter 40 â€“ Facing Fears}

\textbf{Two More for Azkaban: Facing Fears}

\emph{Sunday, August 1, 1993 (the full moon)}

Severus Snape finished locking and securing his home in Spinner's End. Aside from the general spells needed to prevent such mundane occurrences as vandalism and break-ins, he also needed to be sure the little town never noticed the old end of the street and its curious lack of electricity, gas, or any civic improvement for the past twenty years or so. \emph{All I need is a bed and breakfast or a shopping mall in the neighborhood and I'd have to move to Hogwarts permanently.} Everything ready, and his Gladstone bag in hand, Professor Snape concentrated on the outskirts of the village of Hogsmeade in northern Scotland and disapparated.

"There you are," growled a hoarse voice practically in his left ear. "Spot on time."

"Good morning to you, too, Moody. Catch anybody this summer?"

"Lose anybody, you mean. Not that it had anything to do with me, but now there's a vacancy, I thought I might interest you in that vacation I'm always on about."

"Sweet man. So considerate. Try me next year."

"Can't guarantee the same rates next year. Right now it's a bargain."

"Have a thoroughly boring year, Moody."

Alastor Moody laughed heartily as he disapparated back to London. Snape watched the spot where he'd been for a moment, then set off through the town toward the Hogwarts gates. He didn't think he was any earlier than usual, yet Hogsmeade seemed abnormally quiet, as if everyone was still at home asleep.

Approaching the gate, Snape saw Professor Trelawney pacing back and forth, shawls wrapped around her thin shoulders even in the rather warm air. "Good morning, Sibyll," he said, knowing that Trelawney would probably talk his ear off, "Filch not down yet to get the gate?"

"It is part of the doom that hangs over us all, Severus. While Filch tarries in his duty we might be murdered just here, at the very threshold of safety. Mark my words, there will be death at Hogwarts this year."

"I've always admired how you can remain so stoically calm in the face of constant tragedy."

"Have you, indeed? It is not everyone gifted with the Sight that can do so. O where is that Filch? I fear we are in great peril."

"Is there something specific you're concerned with, or just a general sense of foreboding?"

"O Severus, it is that horrible, horrible Black person. They say he is intent on coming to Hogwarts. Is it not so dreadful?"

\emph{Steady, Severus. You haven't read a Daily Prophet in a month, and now Sibyll Trelawney knows something you don't. Stay cool, and she'll never find out}. "I don't think we're in any danger right at this moment, Sibyll. And here comes Filch now, so everything's in order."

Filch opened the magically protected gate, and Trelawney scuttled up the hill to the castle as if hellhounds were at her heels. "Seems a mite skittish," commented Filch.

"Just the recent news. Have you...uh... heard anything more?"

"He's been sighted half a dozen places at the same time. Makes me think folks are more nervous than observant. Then again, a bloke that can get out of Azkaban can most like do anything."

\emph{That explains Moody's remarks, too. A vacancy he wants me to fill.} "They're certain to pick him up fairly soon, though, don't you think?"

"I'd be surprised if he didn't give them the slip. He always was a sly character. You'll know as much about that as anyone, I guess, seeing how often the two of you battled it out in school. My, my, if ever I found slime in the Slytherin corridors or writing on the Gryffindor walls, I could bet my last knut that either Sirius Black or Severus Snape was behind it. No offense, sir, but there were times I wanted to wring your neck."

"None taken," said Snape automatically, but he wasn't listening to Filch anymore. He felt as if he'd been punched in the stomach. As soon as he could, he left Filch and hurried to his own office in the dungeon to digest this shocking news. And as clearly as if it were yesterday, he could hear his own voice coming to him from those dark November days in the hospital wing twelve years earlier:

"If Sirius Black ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him myself."

In the cool dimness of the dungeon office, Snape paced like a caged thing. From a long boarded-up well of memories, emotions gushed like new-tapped oil, dark, viscous, and suffocating. Grief was there, as fresh and wrenching as it had been that Halloween night when he stood, alone and despairing, on the parapet of the Astronomy tower. Guilt was there too, a driving red-hot prod. Overreaching them both was hatred, raw and unyielding. Hatred for the Dark Lord, who hunted rivals like a ravening beast. Hatred for himself, who had given the beast Lily as prey. Hatred for James Potter, who had sacrificed wife and child on the altar of schoolboy sentiment. But above all, hatred for Sirius Black, who had duped his best friend and sold friend, wife, and child to the beast.

Without thought, Snape had picked up and set down jars, paperweights, and vials. He wheeled now and hurled a jar into the fireplace, shattering the glass to slivers with the force of its impact and showering the fireplace and hearth with newts' eyes and green embalming fluid.

There was, at that moment, a tap at the office door. "Severus. Severus, I should like to come in and speak with you." It was Dumbledore.

"Go away and leave me alone!" Snape screamed at the door. "I don't want you! I don't need you!"

"I will not go away, Severus. Now is not a time for you to be alone. If you will not admit me, I shall stay here and listen and wait. I shall not leave you."

"You're a meddling old fool!"

"Yes, and I shall continue to meddle and be foolish while there is breath in my body. Let me in, Severus, and I promise you may yell and shout at me to your heart's content. It is a time for anger. I shall not take that from you."

Suddenly tired and deflated, Snape walked to the door, unlocked it, and opened it to Dumbledore. Behind the Headmaster came Hagrid, and Snape's fury bubbled up anew.

"I don't need a nursemaid!"

"No, of course not. Hagrid is not here to coddle you. He is here to protect me. We understood you might be... destructive." Dumbledore nodded towards the green ooze trickling down the stonework of the fireplace.

"Who told you?"

"Filch. He, too, has known you since you were eleven, and there is a certain icy calm about you that generally precedes a volcanic eruption. Filch is not entirely blind to this. He merely commented that it appeared an explosion was about to occur in the dungeon."

"I believe he used the word 'nuclear,'" said Hagrid.

"Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison."

"Yes, and you must have just heard of it for this to be so immediate a crisis."

"How did it happen? Why?"

"They do not know. Something triggered him to think again of young Potter. He was heard to mutter in his sleep, 'He is at Hogwarts.' He has always shown some resistance to the dementors at Azkaban and managed to give them the slip. They are expecting him to come here after Potter."

"He must be stopped. He must not be allowed to harm the boy."

"For the boy's sake, Severus, or to foil Black?"

"Does it matter?"

"For your sake it might matter very much. Remember that the boy is Lily's son, and for that alone we must strive to preserve him. Remember also, that while evil should not go unpunished, vengeance and justice are seldom the same thing. Are you calmer now?"

"I think so."

"Good. Lunch will be served to the staff in about half an hour, and it would be well if you were there. Hagrid will stay with you for a while. Do not bristle, he is watching out for the school's interests. Many of these items are quite expensive, and Hagrid will ensure that if you chuck anything else at the fireplace, it will come from your private stores and not the school's stocks."

"Thank you, Headmaster," said Snape, breathing a bit more easily. "I think I'll be able to make it to lunch.

Snape and Hagrid went in to lunch together, no more expensive potions ingredients having been spilled in the meantime. Since there were no students, and would not be for a month, the teachers were able to gather around a table in the center of the Great Hall in a more collegial spirit than usual. Hagrid joined them, which he only occasionally did. Today, however, he had a reason for doing so.

"Well, well," Dumbledore began after they were all settled in. "I do hope you all had a quiet, restful summer break. There are several things we need to talk about, but there is no reason we have to wait lunch. We can discuss things as we eat."

Food appeared on the tables as the house-elves sent up the first of the year's many delicious meals, one of the reasons, if truth be told, why the teachers kept coming back to the school year after year.

"Now," continued Dumbledore, "down to business. First, there are two vacancies on the staff that have not yet been filled: Defense against the Dark Arts, and Care of Magical Creatures. The Dark Arts post is particularly difficult, since the rumor has gotten about that there is no job security. I do have one likely prospect whom I shall be able to contact in a couple of days, but he may not be able to arrive at the school until the very start of term."

Snape said nothing. Most of the teachers knew that he would take the Dark Arts job like a shot, but he never spoke of it to Dumbledore as an actual request except in private.

"As to the Magical Creatures position, there have been a few applications, but the best candidate so far both in terms of expertise and of rapport with the students has been Rubeus Hagrid." Dumbledore paused as the teachers gasped in surprise and turned to congratulate Hagrid, who seemed a touch embarrassed. \emph{That's why he came to the table with us. Dumbledore told him to. I wonder if he'll ask for advice on lesson planning.}

Dumbledore tapped a glass for silence. "Now we come to the matter of school security. As you all probably know, Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison. There is reason to believe that he is insane, and that he is obsessed with the idea of attacking Harry Potter. For those of you unaware of Black's history, he was the Secret Keeper who revealed to Voldemort the location of James and Lily Potter, causing their deaths and the destruction of Voldemort. The guards at Azkaban and the Ministry of Magic are both convinced that Black has always wanted to finish the job by destroying Harry as well."

When Dumbledore began speaking of Black, Snape leaned back in his chair and folded his arms, holding the left arm tight against his body in anticipation of what Dumbledore would say. He was thus able to conceal from the others the sharp stab of pain that, at the mention of Voldemort's name, lanced through the Dark Mark tattooed there. Dumbledore knew of it, but there was no reason the others needed to.

"The Ministry," Dumbledore went on, "has asked that all the defenses at Hogwarts be strengthened, and that we be particularly vigilant until Black is recaptured. We do not wish to frighten the students unnecessarily, but we also do not wish to give Black the opportunity to move freely on the grounds.

"On a more mundane note, September first this year is a Wednesday, and so there will be no extra day between the arrival of the Express and the start of classes. Heads of houses will have to interview the new first years during their spare time in the course of the first week. Everyone else is requested not to impose on the heads while they are thus occupied. I believe that is all the business we have for today."

General conversation broke out as the teachers relaxed and gossiped after six weeks of separation from each other.

As Snape expected, Hagrid did want advice on lesson planning.

"It's just that I ain't never had no training t' be a teacher, and I'd like t' do a good job at it, you know."

"None of us had any training, Hagrid. There are no wizard universities or teacher training colleges. Only muggles actually try to prepare people for the jobs they do. We all picked it up by trial and error."

"So what did trial and error show you, if ya don't mind my asking?"

"Establish rules at the outset and be fierce about enforcing them. You can always relax later on, but if you're lax at the beginning, you've lost them. Evaluate their skills at the outset so you know what they need. Try to catch their interest, but don't go overboard. Remember you're there to teach them, not entertain them. Start with the easy things and work your way up to the hard ones. Those are the basics, except for the most important rule."

"What's that?"

"No matter what they do, try not to kill them. I haven't broken that one yet, though every year I'm tempted."

"Thanks. I'll keep it in mind."

Dumbledore sought out Snape after lunch, too.

"I am very much afraid that I shall have to impose on your good nature, Severus."

"I don't have a good nature to impose on," replied Snape, who was busy inventorying materials in the Potions classroom.

Dumbledore ignored this. "Since we have no way of getting a Dark Arts instructor until the last minute, I need someone to see that the classroom, office, and private quarters are in order. General cleaning and straightening up will be done by house-elves, but they cannot check materials and equipment. Would you mind?"

"You do just love rubbing salt into wounds, don't you?"

"I knew I could count on you."

"Just don't make me teach his classes as well."

"I shall keep that in mind."

After supper Snape went down to the lake, and in the gathering dusk lit by a full moon he skipped stones across the placid water. It was a muggle skill Lily'd taught him when they were twelve.

\emph{Do you remember, Lily, the night we broke curfew, stole a telescope, and came out here to try to see the Lunar Landing Module in the Sea of Serenity? It was a moon almost like this one, full and beautiful. There are two full moons this month - one on the first, and the blue moon on the thirtieth. A bad month to be a...}

Snape stopped, the stone poised in his hand. \emph{Why did I think of him? Probably because thinking of Lily, James, and Sirius it's only natural to think of Remus, too. Still, it does fit eerily into what Dumbledore was saying about not being able to contact the new teacher for a couple of days, and his not being able to arrive until September first. The day after the next full moon cycle. If it were a werewolf, he'd be so tired he'd probably sleep during the whole train ride. Silly thought, though. Even Dumbledore isn't altruistic enough to give a teaching position to someone who'd kill children once a month. Twice in August.}

\emph{Kill children. Kill a child. Kill Lily's child.} Snape's thoughts returned to Sirius Black. \emph{Dumbledore says it makes a difference if I try to stop Sirius because I hate Sirius or because I want to save Harry. I disagree. Sirius deserves to die. If it saves Harry, all the better, but Sirius deserves to die. I only hope that when it happens I have a chance to be part of it. But don't worry, Lily. I would never let anyone hurt your son.}

It was late when Snape finally returned to his rooms in the dungeon to sleep.

Two weeks later, Dumbledore found Snape in the Dark Arts office, checking audiovisual equipment to see if the old magic lantern and wind-up Victrola still worked, since neither Quirrell nor Lockhart had used either.

"You might," Snape said as Dumbledore walked in, "consider having electricity run into the castle so that we could get some decent equipment."

"I shall put that on my list of things to do right after oil lamps and fountain pens. We do not want to rush into things too quickly."

"Plumbing was put in early."

"Ah, but that had an immediate practical application. Have you ever used a chamber pot?" Not waiting for an answer, Dumbledore continued. "I did want to tell you that we definitely have a Dark Arts teacher who will arrive on the train."

"Really. Who is it?"

"An old acquaintance of yours. Remus Lupin."

Snape straightened slowly. "I don't think that's wise, Headmaster."

"I am not surprised by your reaction. It is as I expected, which is why I wanted to tell you first and in private. Sit down, Severus, please. We need to talk about this."

"It's insane! It is absolutely insane! How can you hire a werewolf to teach children?"

"Now Severus, it is not as bad as you seem to..." Dumbledore was unable to finish.

"Not bad! Like it wasn't bad when you exposed all of us to a possible attack when I was a student here? You do remember that he came this close to killing me? I don't exactly have fond memories of that occasion."

"That was not Remus's fault."

"No, it was his friend Sirius Black's fault. And, oh my goodness, his friend Sirius Black has just escaped from Azkaban, is coming to Hogwarts to find and kill Harry Potter, and you're letting his old chum the werewolf in as a teacher and an accessory before, during, and after the fact!"

"Severus, you are once again working yourself into an apoplexy. You have no cause whatsoever to think that Remus is helping Sirius. Now you must remember that Remus was James and Lily's friend as well and, maybe even more to the point, Peter Pettigrew's friend. He has as much reason to want Sirius recaptured as you do."

"He's still a werewolf. He's still dangerous."

"You cannot fool me. I know that you know about the werewolf potion that was discovered five years ago. You cannot tell me you did not learn how to make it."

"Some werewolves are allergic to it, and others are immune. It isn't foolproof."

"Remus has been taking it with considerable success. You can help him."

"Me? I've just inventoried his supplies, checked his equipment, put his filing cabinets in order, changed the locks on his doors, and you want me to make him a potion - a very complex and time-consuming potion - every month? And another thing..."

"I knew there was going to be another thing."

"While he's off being a wolf three days out of the month - who's going to take his classes?"

"I thought we would all chip in and help."

"I hate this year already."

"As long as we are all agreed." And Dumbledore retreated, leaving Snape with a vicious desire to smash glass.

\emph{Monday, August 30, 1993 (the full moon)}

Once again Snape was down by the lake after supper, this time huddled next to Lily's rock with his head on his knees.

\emph{I don't know what to do, Lily. I realize he was your friend, but he was never mine. We had a truce at the end, but Lily - a truce was the best we ever got. He always followed Sirius's lead. The first time I ever saw him was when the four of them jumped me at the beginning of third year. And when they attacked me in front of the whole school he was a prefect - a prefect!- and he didn't say one word or lift one finger to stop them. Dumbledore wants me to trust him, but how can I? Sirius Black's little toady.}

\emph{Everything's changing this year, Lily. I'm losing my bearings. Dumbledore isn't wise, Hagrid isn't sturdy - you should see how nervous and timid he is about this class. Who can I talk to that understands the problem? Madam Pomfrey knows. She used to treat Lupin when he was a student. I'll have to sound her out.}

\emph{I'm beginning to really dread seeing Draco Malfoy. I'm sure he was acting as his father's spy last year. It'll be worse this year since Lucius isn't on the Board of Governors any more. Draco will be his only source of information for what's going on here. I'm going to have to be very careful around him.}

\emph{And then there's Harry. I'm sorry, Lily, I don't like your son. He's too much like James - arrogant, self-centered, never thinking before he jumps into things. I wish I could see you in him, but it isn't there. I promise you, though, that I will do everything in my power to see that he's not hurt. If I have to face Sirius, or Remus, or even Dumbledore. Everything in my power.}

The lights were still on in Dumbledore's tower office when Snape finally returned to his rooms in the castle. \emph{Is he watching me?} Something else to worry about.

\emph{He walked by the lake shore in the early evening looking for Lily. A nightingale sang, and the air was perfumed with summer flowers. They were to meet for the rocket launch from the island in the lake's center, and a pavilion was erected for the event. A cool breeze swept off the water to refresh the gathering crowds, refresh them and freeze the flowers.}

\emph{The flower he held had a heart of ice. Its fragile petals cracked, broke, and fell into the water. And from the icy petals frost spread into the lake, freezing its surface and trapping the swimmers, among them Lily and her baby. 'Severus,' she cried, 'Severus, you're killing me, killing me, killed me. You killed me. You.'}

\emph{The people were pointing at him, crying 'Murder, murderer,' and he cried with them, 'I'm a murderer, murdered her, murdered...' as the people turned into frozen flowers and the flowers into birds. Black birds with tattered feathers and bloody beaks that pecked at his eyes and bored into his head and heart, drawing out his thoughts, his breath, his life... dying...}

Snape woke as his body hit the floor, but the dream didn't end. Cold bound his head like iron bands, and the ravens' beaks were long icy fingers that probed into his very soul and stripped warmth, light, joy from him leaving only despair as black as the birds themselves. He was powerless to run, powerless to fight, alone and dying in the cold.

From a great distance he heard a voice, Hagrid's voice muffled in cotton and fading into the freezing night, "They're by the dungeon windows! They're trying to get in through the dungeon!"

Then there was a crash and an explosion as Dumbledore, burning with fury, blasted his way into the room and cried with commanding power, \emph{"Expecto Patronum!"}

Light flooded the room, beating against the cold and the thirsty raven fingers, freeing Snape from the frosty despair and leaving him gasping for breath on the cold stone floor of his dungeon quarters.

Hagrid came lumbering in. "Get him out of here!" Dumbledore yelled, and Hagrid dragged Snape from the room, half supporting him, half carrying him up to the entrance hall, where he pulled off his own coat and wrapped it around the shivering Snape.

All through the castle doors were banging as the teachers ran from their rooms, calling to each other, asking what was happening. Dumbledore came up from the dungeon, his wrath still blazing.

"Minerva!" he called, "come up with me to my office. Cornelius Fudge is coming in about fifteen minutes, whether he wants to or not, and we are going to get to the bottom of this. The rest of you, travel in threes and fours and be sure every possible entrance to the castle is sealed. We have just been surrounded by dementors from Azkaban."

They started up the stairs, but Dumbledore turned with one more order. "Hagrid, stay with Severus. Since they have already touched him, he may still be a target. Keep him warm and get him up to the hospital."

It was two o'clock in the morning.

Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, came at Dumbledore's bidding and stayed for breakfast. Snape was already out of the hospital, having been dosed with chocolate and warm blankets for a couple of hours, though Hagrid still hovered around him like a mother hen.

Dumbledore's anger hadn't faded. "I cannot tell you strongly enough how much I disapprove of dementors being allowed anywhere near Hogwarts. I cannot keep them away from the perimeter, but I will not allow them on the grounds."

"Albus, Albus, they aren't here to harm you, they're here to protect you." Fudge helped himself to eggs and bacon.

"Protect? They attacked one of my teachers."

Fudge lowered his voice and whispered something for Dumbledore's ear only. It may have been meant to pacify, but clearly didn't.

"Mr. Minister, I will thank you to treat my school and my staff with respect, and that includes keeping your dementors away from the grounds and from anyone associated with the school. I will not bargain with you on this. No dementors in Hogwarts."

After Fudge returned to the Ministry, Dumbledore addressed the teachers. "The Ministry of Magic has seen fit to surround Hogwarts with dementors in an effort to capture Sirius Black. While we all object to this measure, when we speak to the students we must treat the Ministry's orders with respect. It would serve no purpose to create an atmosphere of distrust or dissension."

Later, privately to Snape, Dumbledore said, "Tread carefully, Severus. Cornelius Fudge is of a mind that the dementors did not select you at random. He feels your former service may have attracted them to you. Do not give them an excuse to seek you out."

The teachers worked all that day and the next, the day of the students' arrival, to adjust their planned activities so as to keep the students away from Hogwarts's perimeter as much as possible during the school year. It was a long two days, but just after sundown on the evening of September first, they gathered in their good robes to go into the Great Hall for the welcoming and the Sorting ceremony. The train was due at any time.

Dumbledore appeared on a staircase landing. "Ladies and gentlemen," he said, and it was clear he was not happy, "there has been a delay. I have just received an owl from our new Dark Arts teacher that dementors have searched the Hogwarts Express. Under the circumstances, it will be better if you meet the students here, or even outside when the carriages arrive, not just heads of houses. Madam Pomfrey, Madam Hooch, Professor Burbage, if you would meet the boats and be prepared to assist the first years. Professor McGonagall, you may want to separate Master Potter and his friends and talk to them privately. It seems the dementors singled him out for attack."

The teachers separated, the desire to discuss the development overridden by the need to protect their charges. Snape went outside with McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout to assist any students from their houses who might need aid.

\emph{They set dementors on children. You don't set dementors on children. Potter is what, thirteen?} Snape shuddered at recalling his own experience. He kept a fire burning in his quarters now, to drive away the memory of the dementors' cold.

Soon the thestral carriages were climbing the hill, and hundreds of students descended from them to enter the castle for the Sorting and the feast. They seemed somewhat surprised, but also relieved to find all the teachers waiting at the entrance. The meeting with the dementors had shaken them considerably.

"Good evening, Professor Snape," said a familiar voice, and Snape turned to greet Draco Malfoy, flanked as usual by Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Death Eater families, all of them.

"Good evening, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle. Welcome back. I trust you had a pleasant break."

"It was all right. Father specifically asked me to give you his greetings. He's still very interested in what goes on at Hogwarts."

\emph{That was a warning if ever I heard one. Softly, Severus, softly}. "Send my regards to your father when next you write, Malfoy. I'm always pleased to hear from your family." Snape turned to check for more Slytherin students. Malfoy had other business to attend to as well, for Snape soon heard his voice ring out:

"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth? You actually fainted?" He pushed his way forward to confront Lily's son. Snape heard no response but Malfoy's crowing again. "Did you faint as well, Weasley? Did the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?"

Fury bubbled up in Snape as he wheeled toward the little group. \emph{How dare he! How dare he talk of a dementor attack like it was some child's imaginary bogeyman hiding in a closet!} Snape moved through the crowd of students, but someone else got there first.

"Is there a problem?" a soft, calm adult voice said, and Malfoy retreated. The incident was over, and the students broke apart to enter the castle and go to their places in the Great Hall. Snape found himself suddenly face to face with Remus Lupin.

It was an awkward moment.

"Severus," Lupin said, extending his hand. His face was drawn and grayish.

"Lupin," Snape replied, ignoring the hand entirely. "You look terrible. Wrong time of the month, maybe?"

"Dumbledore mentioned that you were teaching here. I was hoping to talk."

"I'm sure you'll want your things taken up to your rooms. They'll be starting the Sorting ceremony in about twenty minutes. Would you like to go upstairs to 'freshen up' after your long trip? Change, perhaps?"

"No, I'm all right. Wouldn't want to miss any of the Sorting."

"Come along, then."

"Severus," Lupin asked as he followed Snape into the Great Hall, "who was the boy who was teasing young Potter?"

"Draco Malfoy," Snape replied without pausing or turning around. "His father was an old 'colleague' of mine." If Lupin was smart, he would take the hint and be cautious around Malfoy. If not...

As they approached the teachers' table, Snape realized something had changed. The Dark Arts professor's seat had shifted down the table - Dumbledore had placed Hagrid between Snape and Lupin. \emph{Should I feel relieved, or should I feel insulted? He doesn't trust us. Or maybe he just doesn't trust me.}

The feast was, for all intents and purposes, a perfectly normal first day feast. The Sorting went smoothly, Dumbledore warned the students about the dementors, Lupin was introduced to lukewarm applause, and Hagrid's appointment was announced. At this last, the Gryffindor table went wild, which was only to be expected, while the other tables were more restrained - and yet still more enthusiastic than they'd been for Lupin.

Snape didn't eat much, but then he never did. Nor did he talk much. Hagrid was clearly too embarrassed at being with the teachers, and Lupin still too affected by werewolf sickness, to want to chat anyway. \emph{He really does look awful. We're the same age, but his hair's going gray already, at thirty-three. Skin gray, too. We'll see if he looks any better tomorrow or Friday. It could just be that yesterday he was covered with fur and going on four paws. Not doing well financially either. Clothes all patched and worn. Who'd hire a werewolf besides Dumbledore?}

Lily's Potter son came into the Hall just after the Sorting, looking none the worse for wear. \emph{He's almost exactly the age his father was the first time James and Sirius bullied and threatened me. Gad, he looks like James. Don't look at James, think of Lily. He must be resilient, though, to recover from a dementor attack so quickly.}

Which brought up thoughts of Sirius Black. \emph{No wonder he tried to escape. Twelve years living with dementors - how could anyone endure that? Deserve it - yes. He sold Lily to the Dark Lord. But endure it - anyone would try to escape. What if he isn't after Lily's son? What if he just wanted to escape? He's been punished for twelve years. If he comes here looking for the boy, I'll know his heart is still evil, but if he's just a refugee from dementors would I go out of my way to hunt him down?}

And of course, Draco Malfoy. \emph{Has he changed since first year, or has he just become less concerned about concealing his mean streak? There was someone else involved, though - Longbottom. Longbottom told Malfoy that Lily's son fainted. Gave him the weapon, as it were. Is he really just an idiot - is it that simple? Or is he one of Draco's toadies, too? Either way, he's responsible for that scene outside.}

"Severus? Severus."

Snape started out of his reverie. Lupin was leaning across Hagrid to speak to him. The feast was over and the students were rising from their places to go to their dormitories.

"Severus, Professor Dumbledore said you could show me my rooms. He said you'd locked them up for me and could release them into my control."

"Of course. It's getting late and you must be very tired after - the last couple of days." They left the Hall together.

"I imagine you're tired, too. One or two of the other teachers mentioned that you were attacked by a dementor in your sleep. It's one thing to know they're coming and try to prepare yourself, but as a complete..."

"I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind."

They climbed the stairs to the first floor Dark Arts classroom, where Snape undid the locking spells and let Lupin look around for a moment. Then they went up another flight to the office and private quarters. Again Snape released the doors into Lupin's control. "I trust you'll find everything in order."

"It's perfect. Severus, I know you spent a lot of time and effort getting the rooms ready for me, and I appreciate it very much. I wish we could resolve some of our differences and learn to live..."

"Why are you here?"

Lupin seemed taken aback by the abruptness of the question. "I needed a job. The Dark Arts position was open."

"I'm not talking about that. Why are you here now?"

"I'd think that would be very clear. Because of Sirius."

Snape nodded. "Ah, but on which side?" he said, and watched as puzzlement, comprehension, and anger flitted in turn across Lupin's face. "Good night, Lupin. You'll remember, of course, that breakfast is at seven. And classes start tomorrow."

"Good night, Severus. Thank you for your help."

"Don't mention it."

Snape returned to the unaccustomed warmth of his own rooms, but had difficulty sleeping. Aside from the too-fresh memory of the dementor, his brain was full of anger and confusion, of Malfoy and Longbottom, Black and Lupin, Lily and her son... He dozed fitfully shortly before dawn and awoke well after sunrise, groggy, bleary-eyed, and in a foul mood. Disturbed at being late for breakfast, he dressed hurriedly and made his way to the Great Hall.

"Y're going t' have t' do something about that Malfoy and his crowd," said Hagrid as Snape took his place at the teachers' table. "They been razzing Harry this morning about that dementor on the train, pretending t' faint and all and telling him dementors is coming."

Snape started to rise to go to the Slytherin table, but a firm hand on his right shoulder kept him in his seat. He turned slightly to see Lupin had moved to stand behind him. "I would prefer you didn't..." he began, but Lupin interrupted.

"Don't make a big thing out of it, Severus. Let it die. The boy can handle it."

"Malfoy doesn't let things die easily. And take your hand off my shoulder."

"Sorry. And no offense to you, Hagrid, but this doesn't need to be blown out of proportion with teachers taking sides." Lupin quietly sat down again and resumed eating his breakfast.

Snape spoke slowly and distinctly. "Are you aware that I am the head of Slytherin house, and that the behavior of those students is part of my responsibilities?"

Lupin's fork stopped halfway to his mouth. He reddened slightly. "No," he said, "I didn't know that." He set the fork down and faced Snape, though it was not easy talking around Hagrid's bulk. "It looks like I put my foot in it that time. I shouldn't have spoken out of turn. I'm..."

"Sorry. Yes, I know. You've made quite a career of telling me how sorry you are for things."

There was an awkward pause. Hagrid was making puffing sounds as if he was trying to get up the courage to intervene. Snape noticed that Dumbledore was watching their end of the table and wondered if he could feel the chill halfway across the breadth of the Hall. He would take Lupin's side, of course. Suddenly Snape didn't want to sit there any longer. "You will excuse me," he said frostily as he rose from his chair, "I have classes to prepare for."

"What about your breakfast?" Hagrid said.

"I'm not hungry." And Snape left the table, slipping smoothly along the side of the Hall and out the double doors.

There were footsteps hurrying behind him.

"Severus. Severus, wait please. We need to talk."

Snape turned as Lupin walked up to him. "I can think of nothing in particular to talk about."

"Why are you still so angry after all these years?"

"You don't understand, do you?"

"Do you?"

The question was so completely different from what Snape had been expecting that he had no answer. Neither yes nor no would be a proper response, and he had no desire to be dragged into longer explanations. Certainly not here. Certainly not now. Lupin was manipulating the conversation, but Snape was not going to play along.

"We must continue this delightful chat some other time, Lupin. I really am busy this morning."

Snape turned and headed for the dungeon. As expected, Lupin got in the last word.

"I look forward to it, Severus. Any time you're willing."

Once in his own quarters, Snape couldn't keep the question out of his mind. \emph{What does he mean, do I understand? What's changed? What's happened to make it possible for me to stomach his presence? Why would he even entertain the thought?}

Then, because he really did have classes to teach, and because he didn't want to think about Lupin or his question, Snape began to shut down, carefully closing and locking all the mental and emotional doors that might inadvertently reveal something that he didn't want seen, didn't want to see, didn't want to exist.

A half hour later, Snape left his rooms for the Potions classroom to set up for the first lesson of the year.

During the second half of Snape's afternoon double Potions class, Professor Sinistra entered the classroom and motioned to him. "Thought you might like to know," she whispered. "One of your students has been taken to the hospital wing. Injured in his Magical Creatures class."

Snape felt the knot in his stomach tighten. He knew what was coming. "Which one?"

"Malfoy. He's been clawed by a Hippogriff."

\emph{Not Hippogriffs for the first lesson, Hagrid. Not Hippogriffs. Temperamental, unpredictable creatures that can eviscerate a grown man with one swipe of their talons. And Malfoy. Why did it have to be Malfoy?} "If you could let Madam Pomfrey know I'll be up at the end of the hour..."

"Big, clumsy, half-wit oaf. They shouldn't let someone like that teach classes. He'll get every student in the school killed. Wait 'til Father hears about this. He'll have that lumpy menace sent up to Azkaban, and this time it'll take more than an owl to set him free." Malfoy was lying in a hospital bed with his right arm heavily swathed in bandages.

"Is it really that serious?" Snape whispered to Pomfrey.

"He's in no danger, if that's what you mean, but he may have scars. The gashes were deep, and they were down by the lake with no one who knew a healing charm. It took Hagrid several minutes to get him up here."

"Damn!" Snape swore under his breath. "Draco will play this for all it's worth, then Lucius will take it up another octave with the Board of Governors and the Ministry. I wouldn't make book on Hagrid's job at the moment, Poppy." Pomfrey returned to her office. Snape went back to Malfoy's bedside.

"Let's go over this again, Draco. Did you say anything that the beast might consider insulting? Please remember that Dumbledore will be interviewing all the witnesses, and if you're shown to be concealing anything it will weaken your case."

"Well, maybe I said it was ugly, but that was all, I swear it."

"Didn't Professor Hagrid warn you that insulting a Hippogriff is dangerous?"

"No. I don't recall him saying that at all."

"Maybe at a moment when you weren't paying attention?"

"You're taking his side! I'm telling Father you're taking his side! We all know what you were, what you are! How long 'll you last if Father gets the Ministry and the Board of Governors against you? Dumbledore can't protect you forever, you know."

"Once again we're talking about witnesses, Draco. Other students will contradict you. You won't win."

"Maybe not. But I could cause a lot of trouble for him just by trying. What do you care about him, anyway?"

"The school is in quite enough uproar over Sirius Black right now. Adding to it won't help anything."

"That's something else you should be happy about. Black's escape. He was on our side and now he wants to finish off Potter."

"I am surprised at you, Draco. Black's information brought about the Dark Lord's fall from power. Hardly something for you to be crowing about."

Malfoy was silent. It appeared it was an angle he hadn't considered. "How should I handle this?" he asked. "Father 'll want something."

"Better the beast than Hagrid. Keep the response appropriate to the injury. It will give you more credibility later."

"All right. I go along with you this time. But you'd better be nice to me or I'll change my mind and go for Hagrid."

"He threatened me. And not subtly either. A direct threat."

"Draco?" Dumbledore poured sherry for Snape and himself, then joined him in front of the roaring fireplace. The large armchairs were warm and comfortable. "Just exactly what did Draco threaten you with, and how did you respond?"

"It wasn't logical. He accused me of siding with Hagrid, then implied Lucius could have me fired by going to the Board of Governors and the Ministry about my past - and present - and then said you couldn't protect me forever. It was as if he were angry because I was a Death Eater and because I was not a Death Eater at the same time. That's what... scares me."

"That is disturbing. It may have just been Draco talking without thinking. And you said..."

"I ignored it. I tried to act as if what he said wasn't important."

"That's excellent. Show him you are not afraid of him and keep him off balance."

"So what do I do now?"

"My sources tell me that what is left of Voldemort - I am sorry, I tend to forget over the summer. I hope that was not too painful. - what is left of Riddle is in Albania. We must assume that there is still some possibility that he will return. If he does, the fact that you may be able to rejoin him could be vital to our success. Make sure that Draco, and through him Lucius, sees that your heart is still on the 'right' side."

"And if Sirius Black comes to Hogwarts? If I have to make a choice between maintaining my role and protecting... him?"

"I doubt that choice will come to you. And he has a name, Severus. It is Harry."

"Thank you, Headmaster," said Snape, who left the office without meeting Dumbledore's eyes.

\emph{Morning of September 3, 1993}\emph{(JKRowling calls this a Thursday, though it would actually have had to have been a Friday.)}

There was a little flurry of activity outside the staff room the next morning. As Snape approached, the talk and whispers died down in a most suspicious manner. \emph{Careful, Severus. Something is afoot.}

McGonagall stepped forward. "Professor Snape, so fortunate that you're here. The staff room seems to have acquired some sort of creature during the night. We were hoping that you might be brave enough to confront it and discover what it is. You have much more experience with such things than the rest of us."

Snape looked around at the assembled teachers, all of them watching him with open admiration. Too much admiration. Badly acted admiration through which gleeful expectation seemed to bubble. "This is a trap, Minerva McGonagall, and I am not walking into it. What's in there?"

"Humph. I'm not telling. If you want to know, you'll just have to go in."

\emph{How bad can it be if the whole staff is amused rather than frightened?} "It is always best to play the curiosity card, Minerva. Much more effective." Snape reached for the door handle, and the other teachers crowded behind him as if eager to look into the room the instant he opened the door. \emph{What is it they want to see that requires my presence?}

Snape opened the door. The teachers pressed forward to look, but there was nothing unusual in the staff room. Nothing at all. "What is this?" Snape started to say, but then the wardrobe began shaking and thumping.

Calmly closing the door again, Snape looked around at the rest of the staff. "That's a boggart," he said accusingly. "You were all hoping to see what I'm afraid of. You will notice, however, that it is the boggart that is afraid and hiding. Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to breakfast." He made his way through the clearly disappointed group and went into the Great Hall.

Hagrid and Lupin were already there, Hagrid being much quieter than usual. "There's a job for you," Snape told him as he took his seat. "It seems a boggart has taken up residence in the staff room. Probably trying to escape the dementors. It'll have to be cleared out."

"A boggart!" exclaimed Lupin. "Don't clear it out right away, Hagrid. That's perfect for my afternoon class. The whole third year curriculum is on dangerous creatures, and there's no better way to start than to show them straight off how to confront their fears."

"I don't know," said Hagrid, looking at Snape.

"It's in the wardrobe. It won't hurt anything. You can take care of it this evening."

It wasn't until much later that Snape realized he and Lupin had agreed on something.

Malfoy wasn't in Potions that morning. The third years were starting complex potion making, which required very careful attention to the preparation of fresh ingredients and the order and timing of their combination. The recipe was on a blackboard in front of the class, and Snape had spent some time going over the specifics. The potion for the day was a Shrinking Solution.

The first half of the session was taken up with explanations and preparation, so that when Malfoy did finally walk into the class at about the halfway point, most of the students were just starting the mixing.

The Slytherin students asked Malfoy how he was doing. The Gryffindor students, who had also witnessed Malfoy's injuries, did not. \emph{Don't let it rankle. It would be the same if the situation was reversed.} Snape shooed the Slytherin students back to their places. "Settle down," he said.

Since Malfoy had just come from the hospital wing where Madam Pomfrey was in charge of his discharge, Snape didn't consider him tardy. There were only a few places left where Malfoy could set up his cauldron, and he chose a place next to Potter and Weasley.

"Sir," Malfoy called a moment later. "Sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots because of my arm..."

Since Malfoy's arm was heavily bandaged and in a sling, it was impossible to argue with this. Snape, who'd been monitoring the class and knew that Weasley's preparations were already well along, didn't even look up. "Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him," he ordered.

Everything seemed to be going well for just under a minute, then...

"Professor. Weasley's mutilating my roots, sir."

Snape went over to the table to look at Weasley's own perfectly shredded roots and the butcher's job he'd done on Malfoy's. \emph{You insolent little puppy! You're deliberately trying to force me into a confrontation. You can't lay aside a grudge for thirty seconds to chop a daisy root? If I can spend hours putting Lupin's rooms in order, you can take half a minute on potions ingredients.}

That wasn't what Snape said, however. What he said, in a smooth and controlled voice, was "Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley."

"But, sir!" Weasley actually acted as if he were the aggrieved party.

"Now."

Weasley obeyed.

Malfoy was obviously savoring the moment. "And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned." The look in the boy's eyes clearly said \emph{Be nice to me.}

\emph{Don't push it}. Snape shifted his glance to the two Gryffindor boys. "Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig."

Out of the corner of his eye, Snape saw Potter fling the shrivelfig contemptuously at Malfoy, but his attention was distracted as the liquid in a nearby cauldron changed suddenly from bright green to orange. \emph{Is all of Gryffindor house conspiring against me today?} The culprit was Longbottom.

\emph{You! Spreading stories and giving people weapons to use against your friends. How fast did you scurry off to Malfoy to tell him about Lily's son and the dementor? Have you no thought for the consequences of your actions? Does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours?}

Snape realized with a start that he'd said the last sentence out loud. It didn't matter. The boy deserved it, and the words came spilling out. "Didn't you hear me... Didn't I state plainly... What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"

Another Gryffindor butted in. "Please, sir, please, I could help Neville..."

The icy calm that Filch would have recognized immediately came over Snape as he turned toward the offending girl. "I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger," he said coldly, then turning back to Longbottom he gave the boy incentive to take more care - "At the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens."

As the now very subdued class returned to its work, Snape went to his desk. \emph{You're losing control, Severus. Why are you losing control?} He began to shut down, jamming the anger, the frustration, the confusion into tightly sealed boxes, plugging the raging volcano, forcing himself to be still.

By the end of the lesson, Snape was quiet again. As promised, he tested Longbottom's potion on the boy's toad, and it worked perfectly. \emph{Probably owing to help from Granger. }The students cleaned up and left the classroom. It was lunchtime.

Snape didn't go to the Great Hall for lunch. He had something more pressing to do. The forced calm had brought comprehension, and he knew why he simmered on the edge of an explosion. \emph{If I open that wardrobe door, I don't know what I'll see. I don't know what I fear most, and the uncertainty is tearing me apart.}

When he was sure the whole school was in the Great Hall eating, Snape rose from his desk in the Potions classroom and went to confront his boggart.

The dungeon corridor was empty, as was the staff room. Snape looked around carefully, then slipped into its familiar, wood-paneled dimness. The wardrobe stood, quiet and apparently quite normal, against a side wall.

\emph{Has Hagrid ignored both Lupin and me and cleared the boggart out already?} In a way the thought was a relief. Snape was not yet sure he wanted to see what the wardrobe contained. \emph{I'm supposed to have a Riddikulus spell prepared, but how do you imagine a funny form of something when you don't know what it's going to be?} The thought occurred to him that he might not be able to drive the boggart back into the wardrobe. \emph{Do I want to see it if I can't get rid of it?}

There was, however, no real point in delaying. Snape took a deep breath, reached forward, seized the knob of the wardrobe door, and pulled it open. The boggart leapt out instantly, and immediately dropped to the floor in a crumpled heap. It was Albus Dumbledore, and he was dead.

Snape stood staring at the limp form. Its eyes were open in a glassy stare, and blood had trickled from its mouth. Slowly, deliberately, Snape backed away from the boggart and sat heavily in a low armchair. \emph{What do I do now?}

In a way he felt curiously unconnected to the image in front of him. \emph{It's because I closed down before I came here. I stepped out of the water just in time. A sea monster's surfaced, but for the moment I'm safe on dry land. I can't stay here forever, though, and when I go back into the ocean I'll be in danger. Best to stay shut off until I'm alone for the night, since I don't know what will happen when I release the waters.}

It made sense, though. \emph{Dumbledore is the only thing I have keeping me from the abyss. He's the only one who knows who I really am and what I've really done. He gives me my only protection and my only purpose. Without him, everything was in vain. Without Dumbledore I'm fodder for the dementors in Azkaban. Without Dumbledore the Dark Lord triumphs and I become his slave. If I lose Dumbledore, I'll have nowhere to go and no one to turn to. Cast utterly alone into the outer darkness...}

Snape shook himself free of the quicksand of his thoughts. It was like being back in the grip of the dementor again, with everything good and pleasant being drained from him. \emph{I have to get rid of this boggart. I have to dismiss it back into the wardrobe.}

How to make the dead Dumbledore funny? Snape regarded the white hair and beard, and pictured Father Christmas - no, the American Santa Claus who climbs down chimneys - getting stuck in a chimney, his fat legs waving over the hearth... "Riddikulus!" he cried, and the image of jolly St. Nick retreated back into the wardrobe.

It seemed like hours, sitting there in the quiet staff room. It wasn't, of course, just lunchtime. Snape had almost forgotten that Lupin was bringing his afternoon class to see the boggart when he heard the sound of many footsteps and student chatter. He roused himself quickly, not hard since he was still shut down and his emotions closed off.

Lupin entered without knocking, and behind him filed the students of his class - the same Gryffindors who'd been in Snape's morning Potions session. Of all the students in Hogwarts, the ones that at this moment Snape least wanted to see. He rose from the armchair as Lupin started to close the door.

"Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this." He made for the corridor.

In front of him was Longbottom. Longbottom, whose very life was a constant reminder of Lily's death, whose every action was like picking at the scab of a festering wound. Snape could feel the locks bursting open, the seals melting, the bonds unraveling as the volcano inside him began building toward eruption. He turned at the doorway to face Lupin.

"Possibly no one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."

The students were silent. Lupin looked at Snape as if shocked, then slowly

comprehension seemed to fill his features. \emph{He knows I've seen the boggart.}

"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation, and I am sure he will perform it admirably."

Snape spun on his heel and went to his quarters. There he sat in semidarkness the rest of the afternoon, fingertips pressed against his forehead, struggling to control the tidal wave inside himself that threatened to drown him in fear and grief. He didn't go to supper, not wanting to see anyone, especially not Dumbledore. Not until he was sure that the students were in their dormitories for the night did he get up from the desk and go into the smaller room to lie down on the bed.

Alone in the darkness, Snape began the slow, careful process of unlocking the doors, unsealing the boxes, and unbinding the chains, letting the caged demons free.

It was a hellish night. Every unsealed box, every unlocked door, was a floodgate of memories and emotions that Snape did not want to see, vivid images of every time he had been cornered or felt trapped. He relived moments with his father, with Bella, Rabastan, and Rodolphus, with the Dark Lord, but a surprisingly large number of them contained the sneering, vindictive face of Sirius Black.

By midnight Snape was exhausted. His body was damp with sweat, and his breath was reduced to shallow gasps. He had to get outside. Rising from bed, where he'd lain fully clothed, Snape groped his way out to the entrance hall and from there to the great oaken doors leading outside.

Once on the steps, he looked up at the moon, now more than halfway up the sky and just a few days past the full. Already he was breathing more easily - the night always relaxed him - and he wanted to go to the lake. He took only a few steps, then stopped. The night sky above Hogwarts seemed full of dementors, and the lake was out of the question.

Slowly Snape backed up the steps and into the castle. There was nowhere to go but back to his room. He was now filled with a horrible, dark depression. \emph{What am I to do if I can't even go outside at night? Is the whole year going to be like this?}

The next morning brought new and unexpected trials. Snape felt sick. He hadn't eaten for twenty-four hours, had been sleeping badly for nearly a week, had a splitting headache, and was emotionally drained. Despite the presence of Lupin, he was looking forward to breakfast, since that would remove the hunger and might help the headache.

As he crossed the entrance hall, Snape noticed that students in small groups were watching him. Watching him, then inexplicably turning away and giggling. Once inside the Great Hall, the phenomenon continued, except that the Slytherin students merely looked embarrassed. At the teachers' table, even some of the professors seemed to find him amusing.

As he sat down next to Hagrid, Snape asked quietly, "Is my nose on crooked or something?"

"Not as I could tell. Why?"

"I seem to be the source of a large amount of good cheer this morning. You wouldn't happen to know about it, would you? "

"I, um... well as to that... I wouldn't. Professor Lupin might."

Lupin, sitting on the other side of Hagrid eating ham and eggs, suddenly remembered he had somewhere else to be. Snape didn't move when Lupin pushed himself away from the table, but as he passed behind them Snape hissed, "Coward."

Lupin stopped. "Don't call me that," he said quietly.

"Why are you running away?"

"I'm not running."

"Are we going to quibble about relative speed in front of the whole school? You're afraid to face me."

"Move over, Hagrid," said Lupin, and sat next to Snape. Both were aware that a large percentage of the school was watching them. "It was the boggart. The boggart changed into you."

Snape looked at the table in front of him rather than at Lupin. "Let me guess - Longbottom. And how, pray tell, did Longbottom get rid of the boggart?"

"He dressed it in his grandmother's clothes."

There was a pause. "As I recall, you were going to work with Longbottom first, which means you would have to help him with his Riddikulus charm. Who suggested the grandmother's clothing?"

There was another pause. "I did," said Lupin. "I..."

"If you say you're sorry to me one more time, I'm going to strike you." Snape stood, slender and proudly erect, still not looking at Lupin. "I seem to have lost my appetite. I do hope you'll excuse me." He walked out of the Hall.

"That's torn it," said Hagrid, not hiding his irritation at Lupin. "Do you know how hard it is to get proper nourishment into him? He ain't eat since yesterday breakfast and now he's off his feed again." He scooped food into a plate, covered it with a table napkin, and stomped out of the Hall leaving Lupin by himself at the end of the table.
