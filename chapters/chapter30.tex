\subsection{Chapter 30: Chapter 30 â€“ Charge}

\textbf{Severus Snape: The Middle Years 1982-1983 - Charge}

Dr. Carmichael returned to Hogwarts at the end of the week, to find herself facing Dumbledore's displeasure. Within an hour of her arrival, she was asked to come to his office. It was a conversation the details of which Snape never learned, but it did not make Dr. Carmichael a more friendly person. The first and most dramatic change was that she found a place in London and began commuting on a daily basis. Evenings at Hogwarts were more relaxed from that moment.

Then the students returned, and Snape found himself the subject of the rumor mill again. Whether or not Carmichael was fueling it in her classes was unknown.

"She dumped him?"

"Wouldn't you? I mean, look at him."

"I never understood why a woman like her would go for a skinny runt..."

"You think maybe he's never had a girlfriend?"

"Imagine being that desperate..."

Only the students in Slytherin house gave him any moral support at all, and he had to ask them to remain silent on the subject in public after one particularly embarrassing shouting match between two Slytherin and three Gryffindor girls in the entrance hall, during which the phrases `like kissing a raven' and `just as short as the rest of him' came up. Snape did not eat supper in the hall that evening.

"They're kids," Hagrid said, dropping by Snape's office with a plate of food that Snape didn't feel like eating. "They'll forget it in a couple of weeks."

"But during those couple of weeks I'll have to endure their whispering and giggling in my classes, in the library, in the Hall, and anywhere else students gather. I hate them. I hate them all."

"Ya can't let 'em smell blood. They'll hound ya for the rest of the term if ya do. Ya got t' show them they're not hurting ya."

"How do I do that?"

"Haven't got a clue."

Snape got a clue two days later in fifth year Potions when Daniel Peterson muttered "sex-starved git" under his breath.

"I beg your pardon, Master Peterson."

"I didn't say anything."

"Yes, you did. Not only I, but half the class heard it quite clearly. Totally aside from the fact that you are projecting your own biological frustrations onto other people, it was not an acceptable comment. Do you see that desk in the corner? You will leave your cauldron and go to that desk immediately, and you will write. `Professor Snape is a sex-starved git' one thousand times with a nonmagical pen. If you do not finish during the class period, you will return for the hour before supper and again after supper. Only when you have completed this happy task will you be allowed to finish your Potions assignment, which must be accomplished before you retire for the night. I shall speak to Professor McGonagall and explain why you might not make it back to Gryffindor house before curfew."

Peterson had no choice but to obey, and the rest of the class was quiet for the remaining time.

"He has to write what!" McGonagall exclaimed when Snape told her.

"I thought maybe after he's written it a thousand times, he'll be so tired of it that he'll never say it again," Snape said as he helped himself to roast chicken at supper. Over at the Gryffindor table Peterson was nursing a sore hand, having made it through over half of his punishment. "And the others will be more circumspect about what they say in my hearing."

"They'll still talk about you behind your back."

"I can't help that. But talking behind my back is just being sneaky. Saying something to my face is a challenge. I wanted him to know I wasn't afraid of the words."

"You may have succeeded. He doesn't look like he wants to be flippant right now."

When Peterson came to finish his task after supper, Snape didn't say anything, simply waving the boy to the corner desk as if the situation were totally routine. It was after eight o'clock when Peterson laid the finished sheets of parchment on Snape's desk. He then went to his cauldron and spent the next two hours doing alone an assignment that he could have finished in half the time with a partner.

At ten-thirty, Peterson put the vial of potion on Snape's desk, his cauldron area already cleaned and ready for the next day. "Thank you, Master Peterson," Snape said quietly.

"Yes, sir," Peterson replied. Snape had no more problems with him in class for the rest of the term.

Midway through January, Rhonda Shoemaker and Anna Prendergast asked to speak to Snape privately. "It's Professor Carmichael, sir. We think she's trying to make trouble."

"Why would you think that?"

"From what the others say. She's talking in her classes."

"About me?"

"We don't know about that. We do know she's talking about Professor McGonagall."

Snape asked them to sit down while he settled behind his desk. "What's she saying about Professor McGonagall?"

The girls exchanged glances. "Anna and I haven't heard her because she doesn't talk in front of the NEWT levels. We think it's because all four houses are mixed together in those classes. The lower levels say she sometimes talks about Professor McGonagall to the Slytherin students. We think maybe she talks about you to the Gryffindors."

"What do the others say she says?"

"That Professor McGonagall hates her because the Professor's son was once in love with her, and that McGonagall always treats Slytherin students differently from the others, that she's unfair. That she holds grudges."

"Does she talk about this on a daily basis?"

"No, but occasional comments a couple of times a week."

"Do you think Professor McGonagall is unfair?"

Anna spoke this time. "We used to think that because she's so strict. We didn't know how she treated the other houses. But now I'm taking Transfiguration for my NEWTs, and she's just the same with a mixed class, and the others don't seem to think it's any different from before, so I guess she treats us all the same."

"You should tell the others that, and tell them not to believe everything Professor Carmichael says about other people."

"What about you, sir?" Rhonda asked.

"Well, we don't know that she talks about me."

"We can find out." Rhonda had the air of a girl with a mission.

Snape wasn't sure that he wanted to find out, but he was already thinking that he would have to go to Dumbledore about the problem, and in order to do that he'd need more complete information. "All right," he sighed. "But just the broad picture. I really don't need any details."

Dumbledore met first with the four heads of houses. Snape reported on what the girls had discovered. "It isn't a running tirade. It's just isolated, occasional comments. She's mentioned both of us in her Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff classes and Professor McGonagall in her Slytherin classes. My students can't check with the Gryffindor students, but one Ravenclaw girl told them the Gryffindor students have heard things about me."

"This is most awkward," Dumbledore said. "and I must consider also the welfare of the students. The very first thing we must do is check to be certain that the classes are following the curriculum and that the students are being prepared for their exams. Dr. Carmichael was brought in to correct a deficiency, and if that deficiency is being corrected I would not wish to punish the students by removing her if some other solution can be found."

That stage proved to be easy. Each head of house checked privately with their own students about all their subjects, so as not to single out any particular teacher, and reported back that Carmichael's students were all doing well and had an excellent grasp of the subject matter. Snape, and even McGonagall, admitted that there seemed to be no prejudice or favoritism shown between the houses, and that Carmichael's assignments and grading appeared fair and impartial.

"So whatever it is she has against the two of you, it does not spill over into other aspects of her job." Dumbledore thought for a moment while the heads of houses were silent. "Minerva, Snape, do you think you can you make it to the end of the school year without any explosions? Assuming the circumstances stay the same as they are now, of course, and do not escalate. We are, in any case, still waiting for a report on the Ministry investigation, and there is little I can do until then except reprimand her."

"I think so, sir," said Snape, and McGonagall reluctantly agreed. After a quick consultation, they both asked Dumbledore not to say anything to Carmichael. They didn't want to take the chance that her behavior might worsen.

The beginning of February brought the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff Quidditch match. This was an important game for both teams, since Gryffindor had lost its first match in November against Slytherin, and Hufflepuff had won its match in December against Ravenclaw. If Hufflepuff won, Gryffindor's chances to win the Quidditch Cup would practically disappear. The whole school was turning out to watch, though the weather was too cold to expect visitors.

Snape, however, was doomed not to be able to see the match, since Robards arrived from the Ministry right at the beginning of lunchtime that Saturday, asking to speak with Dumbledore. Half an hour later, Snape was called to Dumbledore's office.

"You sent for me, Headmaster?" was all Snape said when he entered the room, his face cold and closed.

"Yes, Professor Snape. Mr. Robards has come to advise me of the progress of the Ministry investigation. He has asked that you accompany him to London to take a formal deposition."

"Isn't Saturday an unusual time to be doing this?"

"We thought," Robards said, "that it would be less obvious and cause fewer problems for you if it didn't disrupt any of your classes. With a Quidditch game going on, most of the school won't even notice."

"I would prefer not. My memories of the interior of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement are not of the best."

"I understand. The deposition will be taken in front of Judge Bones. There will be a stenographer and myself. You'll be back before supper."

"No Moody?"

"Mr. Moody will not be there."

Snape agreed, and the two walked down the hill together while the school finished lunch, and apparated to London.

"You know," Snape remarked as he followed Robards down into the depths of the Ministry, "this is the first time I've been this far that I didn't have my hands tied. Except for the trial."

"I trust this experience will be a bit less unpleasant."

"I note that you don't expect it to be pleasant."

"Things like this never are."

They entered a hearing room and went to the table at the front. Judge Bones came in a moment later with the stenographer. "Thank you for accommodating us, Professor," she said, and they all sat down, the stenographer at another table, out of Snape's line of vision.

"You need to know," continued the judge, "that you're the last person being deposed in this case, unless something totally unexpected surfaces. We'd like you to be as candid and detailed as possible in your responses. I do have to warn you that all of this is under penalty of perjury, so at the same time you need to consider carefully what you are saying."

The first questions were routine, about Snape's identity and his job at Hogwarts. Then came a series of questions about his being a Death Eater, which turned out to be easier than he'd expected since Robards didn't ask him any names or to betray any trusts.

"When did you first meet Dr. Carmichael?"

"Last August. There was quite a gathering of outsiders to welcome her to the school."

"What did you say to each other."

"I was introduced to her in a reception line. She made a comment on my youth. We didn't speak for the rest of the gathering until the end."

"Is it true that Professor McGonagall tried to keep you apart?"

"I believe so. After a while I got the impression they didn't like each other."

"Did you know at that time about Professor McGonagall's son?"

"No. Professor Flitwick told me about it later."

"Did she know at that time that you'd been a Death Eater."

"I don't think so."

"When do you think she found out?"

"After the first poisoning incident. There was a Quidditch match, and she sat talking to Mr. Moody the whole time. I suspect he told her, because after that she knew."

"Before that, how did Dr. Carmichael speak with you?"

"She used highly suggestive language, and teased me about being embarrassed by it. I was trying to find ways to maintain my composure."

"Is that why you purchased the book on sexual customs?"

"Yes. It was helping, too. Some of the things she said to me later weren't such a surprise, and I was able to control my reactions. Until she threatened to use the book against me, of course."

Robards and the judge glanced at each other. "Did you tell her about the book?" Judge Bones asked.

"No. I got the impression that Mr. Moody told her about it at the Quidditch game."

Another exchange of glances, and Robards jotted something down in a notebook. Then Robards took up the questions again. "What kind of threats did she use?"

"She said she could spread rumors that I was interested in my students in inappropriate ways. She said that if I kept company with her, an older woman, then I wouldn't be vulnerable to rumors like that."

"Did she happen to say why she was interested in you?"

"She said she had a reputation to maintain, and I'm the only male teacher at Hogwarts who's younger than she is."

"Is that when you asked her for a date?"

"I didn't ask. She told me to take her to dinner and a movie. I asked what movie she wanted to see, and she told me to surprise her."

There followed extensive questions about the movies and the restaurants. Then, "Did she ever mention Professor McGonagall to you?"

Snape told them Carmichael's version of the incident involving McGonagall's son, then added, "I think the inexperienced teacher who was responsible for her not being prepared for her NEWT was Professor McGonagall."

This brought another exchange of glances. "Did she ever express any particular enmity toward Professor McGonagall?"

"Only that she thought the Professor was responsible for driving her own son from Hogwarts, and that it wasn't reasonable for her to blame Dr. Carmichael for it."

"Professor, how much did you know about Dr. Carmichael before August?"

"I read a couple of her books. They were very good. Very informative. I didn't know anything about her, though."

"Do you know anything about the poisoning attacks that caused her to leave Britain in 1979? The attacks ordered by Lord Voldemort."

"No."

"Were you ever asked to brew poisons?"

Snape hesitated. "Yes, four times. I was told it was for safe houses that were kept free of traceable magic, and were to kill vermin, rats. I used arsenic and strychnine. Neither would have produced the symptoms Dr. Carmichael experienced."

"Did you ever hear of anyone assigned to attack Dr. Carmichael?"

"No."

"Did you read \emph{The Daily Prophet} that appeared two days after Christmas?"

"Yes. I considered it directed at me personally."

"Why would she attack you personally?"

"I'd told her a few days earlier that I wouldn't stay with her in London and that I wasn't attracted to her."

"Was she at Hogwarts at the time you read the interview in the paper?"

"No. She was spending Christmas week with her publishing agent." A light came on in Snape's head. The page from the book that Judge Bones had shown him in December credited Dr. Carmichael's survival of the first poisoning attempts to the quick action of her husband and her publishing agent. "Wait a minute," he said quickly, "if this was an idea of her agent's it might explain why I never heard anything..."

"Please, Professor Snape," said Judge Bones quietly. "Don't speculate. Confine yourself to things that you know from personal experience."

Snape looked from Judge Bones to Robards. "This isn't new to you," he said. "What have you found out about..."

"Professor Snape," said Robards sharply. "If you think we're going to discuss the particulars of a case with one of the suspects..."

"Thank you, Gawain," said the judge. "Professor, you're here to answer questions. While Mr. Robards has been more brusque than I would have been, the point is well taken. It would be wrong for us to discuss the matter with you outside the area of your own knowledge. Now, if we can return to the deposition?"

The questioning went on to Snape's experiences since the appearance of \emph{The Daily Prophet} interview, and he was able to tell them what Rhonda and Anna had brought to his attention. Then the questioning turned to poisons and his knowledge of their effects. Snape had to confess that he didn't know what poison might have caused Dr. Carmichael's symptoms.

Several hours after it had begun, the deposition was over. Robards escorted Snape back up to the London streets, and watched as he apparated back to Hogwarts. So far as Snape knew, his business with the Ministry was over for the time being, but the experience had given him a reason for starting an investigation of his own.

"You must know something!" Snape insisted, following Madam Pomfrey around the hospital wing like a shadow. "You took samples - both times. Those samples were analyzed by the staff at St. Mungo's. You must have some idea what the poison in them was."

Pomfrey wheeled on him in exasperation. "Severus, St. Mungo's isn't going to tell me anything in a criminal case. Listen carefully. I. Do. Not. Know. What. They. Found!"

"Look," Snape insisted, not wanting to let go. "In both cases the reaction was violent but not fatal. What if there was never an attempt on her life? What if she administered the poison to herself? What if this is all part of a publicity stunt that was started four years ago?"

"You can talk until your jaw drops off, Master Snape. I can't tell you what you want to know because I don't know it, and if I did, I still wouldn't tell you. Now run along and bother someone else."

The next step had to be planned carefully because Snape didn't know how Professor McGonagall would react. If she was like Pomfrey, any hint of what he was doing would remove forever any hope of assistance from her. He waited until the middle of the month to make his move.

\emph{Friday, February 11, 1983}

Valentine's Day that year was a Monday, and the staff was discussing the decorations the Friday evening before. That Saturday was a Hogsmeade excursion.

"Just not too much pink," said Kettleburn. "Ghastly color, pink, and not really a Valentine's color at all."

"No?" said Sprout. "I thought pink was very Valentiny. I've always seen it."

"Red and white," rejoined Kettleburn. "That's Valentine colors. Red and white."

"And brown," added Dawson. "For the chocolates, of course."

"Where would I go," Snape asked incongruously after a moment's silence, "if I wanted to find out something about a student's family?"

"You have the Slytherin files," said Flitwick. "If it's a Ravenclaw student, you ask me."

"No," Snape said, "I mean further back than that. I have a student - you know Kate Digby? - who's killing herself because both her parents got Outstanding in all their OWLs, and I want to find out if it's true. Because if they're lying to pressure her into trying to match them, I think I should know about it."

"Archives are on the fifth floor," said Flitwick. "The wall just past the statue of Gregory the Smarmy. You identify yourself as a teacher, and the wall should let you in."

That evening Snape went up to the fifth floor. He spoke to a couple of non-responsive walls before he found out what `just past' the statue of Gregory the Smarmy meant, but he eventually made it into the archives.

From there it was easy. Graduating class of June 1957, file of Valeria Messalina Aurifosser. Snape's hands were trembling a little as he opened the rather large file folder. What he found made him settle into a quiet, deadly calm.

\emph{Aurifosser, Valeria Messalina. NEWT Results: Ancient Runes: Acceptable; Arithmancy: Exceeds Expectations; Charms: Acceptable; Defense against the Dark Arts: Outstanding; Potions: Exceeds Expectations; Transfiguration: Disqualified for cheating.}

Snape studied the page carefully until he was sure it was committed to memory then, with a feeling of intense guilt, as if he were carrying out some heinous crime, he found the file of Marcellus McGonagall.

It was a thick file, for the boy seemed to have been constantly defying authority. Looking at the incongruous disparity between Outstanding and Poor grades, Snape couldn't help but have the feeling that young Marcellus had been deliberately failing exams, and wondered if it hadn't been to avoid a future he didn't want, for those failed exams were ones that would have helped him the most in a Ministry job.

\emph{So Carmichael was lying and telling the truth at the same time. And what of McGonagall? She hasn't lied because she hasn't said a word about either Carmichael's school career or her son's, except for the incident that ended it in his seventh year. But why would Dumbledore hire a Professor who'd cheated on a NEWT?}

Back in his own rooms pondering the question, it occurred to Snape that Dumbledore hadn't been headmaster at the time, and was therefore not involved with the cheating incident, which had been in Transfiguration. But what subject did Dumbledore teach?

Saturday morning at brunch, Snape asked Flitwick.

"Dumbledore? He taught Transfiguration for decades. I believe he has the longest teaching career in Hogwarts history. Except for Melusine FitzMarmaduke in the 12th century, of course. And Gertrude Hexenmacher in the 18th and 19th. And how could I overlook our own Professor Binns? And then there was Cantilupe Smith..."

"But if Professor Dumbledore was teaching Transfiguration, why did they hire Professor McGonagall?"

"Oh, that! And in the middle of the school year, too. Such a shock. Poor Armando. That was when Professor Dippet had his first attack. Took us all quite by surprise when he showed up like that right in the middle of the fountain court... Dear, dear. Well, Albus was Deputy Headmaster, and he had to take over Armando's duties for a while, until the attack subsided, of course, and they brought in Minerva to handle Transfiguration since Albus had so much to do."

"What was wrong with Professor Dippet?"

"At first they said it was jeranculus fever, but then it turned out that it ran in the family. They had to institutionalize his maternal grandfather, you know. He'd be fine for a long time, then have these spells that lasted for months. Dumbledore covered for him - wouldn't let the Board of Directors dismiss him - it wasn't dangerous or contagious so it didn't bother the rest of us. But poor Albus certainly had his hands full."

\emph{Full enough so that minor things like a student caught cheating wouldn't attract his attention? Very possible. So I can accept the probability that Professor Dumbledore didn't know. And what is important for Carmichael's job now, of course, is Dark Arts. Not just that Outstanding she got but, even more important, all the experience since.}

The Hogsmeade excursion promised to be easy on the teachers. It was cold enough at the beginning of February that most of the students would stay indoors somewhere, and in any case the main attraction was Honeydukes Sweetshop, where they were buying Valentine treats for girlfriends, boyfriends, and just friends. Snape went to the Three Broomsticks.

That turned out to be something of a mistake, since shortly after Snape settled into a booth at the back of the main room, a shadow covered his table.

"You been trying to get me into trouble, haven't you?" growled Moody as he joined Snape in the booth. "Don't get up now. This is just going to be a `friendly' chat."

"I haven't done anything to get you into trouble."

"No? It's not bad enough you lose me an eye and near get me killed, you've got to be spreading tales that I give Ministry information to outsiders."

"I don't understand."

"You told Robards that I was telling Carmichael about the results of an investigation into possible criminal activity. Now where'd you get that idea?"

"The remarkable expansion of the extent of her knowledge following a Quidditch match. Quidditch doesn't increase that kind of mental acuity, and you were the only one talking to her during the game."

"How would you know that?"

"When I'm in the water, I always keep my eyes on the predators. A confluence of sharks is a sign of danger."

Moody leaned forward and spoke in a low, conspiratorial tone. "A lot of Death Eaters are walking free, but most of them blame their slips on Imperius spells. You're the only one who claims to have double-crossed your lord. That's Top Secret right now, but it won't be forever. Maybe Azkaban isn't the worst place for you to be." Then he rose and stumped out of the Three Broomsticks.

Moody's arrival and departure did not make Snape change any of his own plans for the day, nor did it cause him any great concern, which was a matter of some interest to him. \emph{A year ago, he would have had me locking myself in my rooms in the castle just by his appearance. What's changed?}

It didn't take long to identify. Moody was alone. Scrimgeour had forgotten Snape completely, it seemed, and neither Robards nor Judge Bones trusted Moody. Or at least they distrusted him enough to check out Snape's allegations in his deposition. \emph{I don't have the whole Ministry against me. Just one disgruntled auror. True, he could be dangerous, but still... It's one on one now.} It was a satisfying thought.

\emph{And he can't threaten me with Azkaban anymore. That's interesting. He'd like to, but it isn't as immediate a possibility as it was last year. That's why he's threatening me with the revenge of other Death Eaters. But who do I really have to worry about? Malfoy? Avery? Neither one wants more trouble. The Carrows? They're not a threat to me. Everyone really dangerous is in Azkaban, and no one escapes from Azkaban.}

The afternoon wore on without any further problems, and shortly before supper Snape assisted the other teachers in shepherding the last of the students through the Hogwarts gates and up the hill to the castle. Snape was, in fact, so calm about the incident that he didn't even mention it to Dumbledore.

\emph{Tuesday, February 22, 1983}

The last week of February brought Gawain Robards back to Hogwarts on Tuesday the twenty-second just before lunch. Dr. Carmichael was called to Dumbledore's office first, and some little time later Snape and McGonagall together. The only unpleasantness was that Carmichael was on the second floor in front of her rooms as if waiting for them, but when they passed on the stairs she did nothing more than wrinkle her nose, turn abruptly, and slam the door shut behind her.

Robards brought good news. "We're suspending the investigation. Other than her symptoms, we've been unable to uncover any evidence that she was poisoned at all. Nothing showed up in lab analysis. Your own meticulous records, Professor Snape, proved invaluable in showing that no school poisons are unaccounted for, and even Alastor Moody helped your case, though he hated doing it."

"How was that?" Snape asked, more curious than he would have admitted.

"He's been having you followed. We can trace every moment of your time off Hogwarts grounds since you learned that Dr. Carmichael was going to be teaching here. At no time did you have an opportunity to purchase or gather poisons. Everything on the grounds has been accounted for.

"So this whole ridiculous thing is over?" McGonagall asked.

"No. Not over. Suspended. Should new evidence come to light, or should another incident occur, it will be reopened immediately."

Snape and McGonagall followed Dumbledore and Robards down as Dumbledore escorted Robards out of the castle, and thus witnessed a scene on the second floor, for at the sound of feet on the stairs, Carmichael came bursting out of her office, a book in her hand.

"I want you to know this isn't over," she snarled at Robards. "They tried to kill me, and I'm not going to rest until they're jailed for it!"

"We understand that you might be upset," Robards replied calmly, "but as we have no concrete proof that poisoning took place..."

"Because you couldn't detect it? That means nothing!" She waved the book under his nose. "When I was in South America, I wrote a whole treatise on undetectable poisons, and if you'd ever read it..."

"I assure you, Dr. Carmichael, that your expertise in undetectable poisons was one of the things we examined closely in our investigation."

Carmichael froze, her eyes glittering dangerously. "How dare you!" she spat, venom in her voice. "I risk my life every day in this place, murderers sitting at the same table with me..."

"Valeria," Dumbledore interjected, "I understand that you are upset, but has it not occurred to you that you have been mistaken..."

"Mistaken! I am being denied justice! And if I can't get justice from the Courts of the Ministry, I'll get it from the Court of Public Opinion!"

"I wouldn't advise that," said Robards calmly. "All sorts of things can come up in a libel suit, nasty little things from the past. It isn't one-sided, you know."

"I don't care! I want the people who tried to kill me! If you won't do it, I will!" Carmichael stormed back into her office.

"I apologize, Gawain," said Dumbledore. "I really must see that Valeria is all right. You can see yourself out, I am sure." And then Dumbledore went into Carmichael's office as Robards continued down the stairs.

March started with intense disappointment and went downhill from there. The Slytherin - Ravenclaw game was on Saturday the fifth. A Slytherin win would put Slytherin in first place, since Gryffindor had beaten Hufflepuff the previous month, and it would shut Ravenclaw out of any hope of winning the cup. The Snitch, however, put in an early appearance, and was caught by the Ravenclaw Seeker. Snape was now immensely grateful for the high-scoring game against Gryffindor at the beginning of the season, as was McGonagall. Only the winners of each of the next two games would have two wins for the season. The Quidditch Cup would go to whichever of them had the overall highest score.

The seventh of March brought more trouble. Tuesday's \emph{Daily Prophet} contained another interview with Val Carmichael.

\emph{Reporter: Is it true that you've moved into a place in London? That you're not living at the school anymore?}

\emph{Dr. Carmichael: It was a necessary precaution. There's a limit to how much protection one can be given in an environment where potentially dangerous people are under little supervision or control.}

\emph{Reporter: Are you saying that there are people at Hogwarts who are a danger to you?}

\emph{Dr. Carmichael: I have been attacked twice, and despite my offers of assistance in evaluating the evidence, the Ministry has been unable to locate the agent involved. At least that's what I've been told. I thought it best to limit my time on the grounds and look out for myself.}

\emph{Reporter: Do you have any idea who's behind these attacks?}

\emph{Dr. Carmichael: I hesitate to say. I've even been threatened with legal action for speaking of my doubts, and by the Ministry, no less. But there are people there who still have connections to You-Know-Who, and who are still loyal to him and bound to carry out his death order against me, perhaps even the children of his followers. And of course, a person in my position is the subject of jealousies and false accusations, so there are those who bear grudges, however unwarranted..."}

\emph{Reporter: Well, we all certainly hope you stay out of harm's way, and that the perpetrators of these attacks are discovered and stopped.}

The whispers started again with the appearance of the interview, and Snape became aware that it was common report that he'd tried to ingratiate himself with Carmichael in order to have an opportunity to poison her. Outside of Slytherin house, it was considered fortunate that she'd discovered his nefarious intentions before he succeeded.

There was nothing Snape could do. Any attempt to squelch the rumors only intensified them. Every aspect of his private life was suddenly under a microscope again - his appearance, his past, his mannerisms, his relationships or the lack of them - the students dissected them with relish. He hated them all, and a longing to knock their heads together raged in him. The sheer physical effort of controlling his actions was taking its toll. It found release in a cold, bitter manner and in his tongue.

"Fascinating, Carmody, that you should consider yourself better qualified at Potions than the author of the book. Tell me, when you reversed the order of the ingredients, did you intend to produce green slime?"

"Thought you would hurry things along by adding a catalyst, Palmer? Gryffindor always did have a tendency to mistake reckless stupidity for brains. Now you get to clean it up and start over."

"A remarkable essay, Saltensall. It would never have occurred to me that one student could make so many errors in such a short piece of writing. You've set a personal record, possibly a school record."

One result of \emph{The Daily Prophet} interview and its aftermath was that Dr. Carmichael no longer came to the Great Hall for any meals. Students speculated that it was from fear of poison. Another result was that Snape no longer left the school grounds on his evenings off. Every time he went somewhere, students began discussing what he might be up to.

It was at the height of this unpleasantness that the spring term ended and Easter break began. Students swarmed to leave the school, and it appeared that for two blessed weeks Snape would not have to close his ears to murmurs and innuendo. There was nothing he wanted more than to escape the very sight of Hogwarts.

"Leave the school for the Easter break, Severus? That is rather unusual. Normally the heads of houses stay." Dumbledore and Snape, along with the rest of the staff, were walking up the hill from having seen the students safely onto the train.

"I just have to get away from here, sir. A change of scenery, a chance to relax. I was thinking of going home for the break if you permit it."

"Very well, Severus. You have permission to spend the break at your home, as long as someone else is empowered to watch over the Slytherin students who are staying."

The someone was Sprout, and by mid afternoon everything was arranged. Snape walked back down the hill around three o'clock, feeling more lighthearted than he had in weeks, and apparated to Lancashire.

Mrs. Hanson saw him walking in from the moors and called out, "Hoo, dearie, that school of yours out so soon? I didn't know you'd come back."

"I just got in this morning, Mrs. Hanson. I thought I'd walk from the station. It's a nice day's outing and a good change from books and papers. I'm on Easter holiday."

"The exercise is good for you, too, Russ. Eileen 'd be pleased t' know her son was caring for his health. How long will you be with us?"

"Two weeks, if all goes well."

"Then you'll be coming to take tea with me."

"I will, and with pleasure."

"Good. Tomorrow, tea time, and we'll have a chat."

"I look forward to it. Have you taken to using a cane now, Mrs. Hanson."

"It's the arthritis, child, the arthritis. If you've got healthy joints, thank the stars for them."

"Let me know if there's anything I can do for you."

"You've always been a good lad."

Snape bade her `good afternoon' and went to his own home, throwing all the windows open to the April breeze and fixing himself a cup of tea. For a couple of hours he just cleaned and straightened things that were already clean and straight, then began to think about supper.

\emph{I don't want to go shopping, not now. Maybe a light supper at the pub.} It turned out to be an excellent idea. Many of the regulars were already there, some with their missus, and a dart game was in progress. Snape was greeted with `Lookie here, it's young Snape back from that posh school!' and his first pint was on the house. He ordered steak and kidney pie, just to spite Carmichael, and enjoyed it thoroughly as he finished his pint.

Sunday evenings tended to be jolly in a quiet sort of way, most of the men having to work the next morning. They hauled Snape from his table to join the dart game, and this time he managed to hit the board more often than the wall, to good-natured cheers and laughter. Then he got a dart actually in the center ring, which earned him pats on the back, another pint, and the accolade `maybe there's a bit o' ol' Toby in you after all.'

That evening Snape got home about ten o'clock. He went right to bed and slept soundly.

Monday Snape wandered up to the top of Pendle Hill just to survey the surrounding country. It gave him a sense of peace, and the order of things. In a way, he could sympathize with the wizard distrust of the muggle world in the past, but he was beginning to have trouble understanding the reluctance of muggle-borns and half-bloods to acknowledge their muggle roots. Now, at last, after the turmoil of the last few years, he was beginning to realize once more how much strength and stability it gave him.

At tea time Snape appeared punctually at Mrs. Hanson's door, to spend a gentle hour and a half listening to all the gossip with a willing ear. It was good to know whose bird hound had just dropped a litter of fine pups, and which of the neighbors had spent three days in lockup for drunk driving, and how Mrs. Jackson's Mary and Mrs. O'Shay's Catherine were both after the same young man. There was an innocence to it that was worlds away from the rumor mill at Hogwarts.

For the next couple of days, Snape was lazy. He roamed the countryside, took tea with Mrs. Hanson, and supped at the pub where he was beginning to really improve at darts. Then, on Wednesday, he decided to start cooking at home.

Shopping was a pleasure. He was now somewhat familiar with different kinds of foods and spices, and had a particular dish in mind when he looked for meat, vegetables, and condiments. He was debating which of two quite nice pork chops to buy when he was greeted by Mrs. Hanson.

"It's good t' see a young man shopping for himself, and doing the cooking, too, by the looks of it."

"I'm trying some new things, Mrs. Hanson. Perhaps if I'm successful I'll invite you over for supper one of these days. I don't want to subject you to an experiment though."

"That's all right, dearie. I've subjected myself to enough of my own."

Snape moved on to the fish and seafood counter. They didn't carry shrimp, not that day at least, but there were mussels and oysters.

"Best buy them now while you can," said Mrs. Hanson. "This is the last until September. You're not supposed to eat them in months without an `R', you know."

Snape made his selection of oysters then asked, "Aren't you going to get any, Mrs. Hanson?"

"Me? Love you, dear, but I can't. Five hours after I eat them, I'm as sick as a dog. I got me one of them allergies."

"That's too bad," Snape replied. "to be deprived of something you enjoy because of a reaction. Can I help you with your bags? I'm on my way home now, too."

Mrs. Hanson handed him her bags, chatting briskly now that she was free of their weight. "You always were the politest little thing, even late at night when you got hauled out of bed t' get you out of your dad's way. Always `yes, ma'am' and `no, ma'am' and no backtalk. And I won't pretend it's not harder with the cane, getting all unbalanced and all. I saw one of them walker things in a magazine. I wouldn't normally go with a walker, not being ninety, and half in my grave, but this one had a grocery basket on the front so it was more like having a little wheeled cart, and wouldn't that be grand for shopping with no bags to carry..."

"Mrs. Hanson?"

"Yes, dear?"

"I don't mean to be rude, but what happens to you five hours after you eat oysters?"

"La, child! You don't want t' know. I get sick out both ends and shaking like to have the ague. You don't want no particulars."

Snape's mind was working out the time difference between appetizers and late glasses of sherry. "On the contrary, begging your pardon, Mrs. Hanson. I think I know someone who would be fascinated. He's writing a treatise on allergic reactions, and I think he'd love to talk to you. Maybe even as soon as tomorrow tea? I could let you know for certain as soon as I give him a ring."

"Someone wanting my allergy for a tree-tis? Love you, dearie, that's one for my old age! But it's good t' have company for tea. If he wants t' come, he can come."

Snape saw Mrs. Hanson home and her bags onto the kitchen table, then he went to his own home and apparated to London from the area yard. In the atrium of the Ministry of Magic, he asked to speak to Gawain Robards. Once again he was directed to a waiting room.

"I didn't expect to see you here," was Robards first comment as he entered the room fifteen minutes later. "Has something happened?"

"Maybe, but I'd rather not color your viewpoint by telling you too much. Do you think you could talk to an old muggle woman tomorrow around four o'clock? I believe she has information that could assist you in your case."

"A muggle?"

"A lady I have known from my childhood. She mentioned something today that might interest you."

"And it concerns a certain author of our mutual acquaintance?"

"Most likely."

Robards met Snape in Manchester the following afternoon at three, and they apparated together to the moor land outside Snape's home town. Even before going to his house, Snape insisted that Robards alter his choice of clothing.

"The tweed jacket and the plus fours aren't too bad if you pretend you're a golfer, but the bowler hat has got to go."

"I thought it was required for a businessman."

"Twenty years ago with a three-piece suit. Take my word for it. No bowler hat."

They arrived at Mrs. Hanson's at precisely four. Mrs. Hanson was arrayed in a flowered dress from about two decades earlier, and appeared to have taken more than usual care with her hair and makeup, which Snape knew was a tribute to the special nature of the occasion. It was not every day that perfectly mundane little Mrs. Hanson was interviewed for a tree-tis, and Snape was immediately on his guard that Robards treat her with the proper respect due her.

"Mrs. Hanson," Snape said, "thank you for your kindness in allowing us to visit. May I present Dr. Robards, who holds a government position and is researching allergic symptoms. Dr. Robards, Mrs. Hanson."

"Charmed, Mrs. Hanson," Robards said as he took her hand. "I hope we are not inconveniencing you too much."

"Not at all. Not at all," she replied, ushering them into her small house. "Please come in. Sit yourselves down in the parlor, and help yourselves. I'll pour tea."

Inside the parlor was a brave little show of watercress, cucumber, and egg salad sandwiches, the crusts trimmed and cut into triangles. Mrs. Hanson had baked scones as well, and splurged her pension on clotted cream. One little plate even held a half dozen petits-fours. Snape wished he'd thought to fill Robards in on the widow's relative poverty, but could only trust for the moment to Robards' good sense.

They ate sandwiches and sipped tea for a quarter of an hour, engaging in local gossip that Robards added the occasional comment to, then Snape took over. "I hope you'll excuse me, Mrs. Hanson, but I thought it might be a good moment to bring up Dr. Robards' research. He's studying allergies, and I mentioned yours to him."

"Ah, yes," said Robards. "I am most anxious to hear of your symptoms."

"Well, it don't seem quite right t' be talking about it while we're eating..."

"Do not worry, Mrs. Hanson," Robards said quickly. "I am quite used to it, and it will not bother me at all. What are you allergic to?"

"Oysters, love you. Didn't Russ tell you?"

"And what happens to you when you eat oysters?"

"Nothing for five hours. Fit as a fiddle. Then I start t' get nervous and anxious, then a bit queasy, and then I'm sick as can be. It happens all sudden like, from one moment t' the next."

There followed a detailed account of diarrhea, vomiting and chills, but Robards made it all sound very official and flattering, as if Mrs. Hanson's answers would solve the riddles of disease and poverty on the earth. He wanted to know everything, and the sordid little details of nausea and toilets became, in his handling, the clinical wonders of modern science.

"And for how long did you suffer these extraordinary chills, ma'am?"

"Nigh on forty-five minutes, but when they got better, I knew I wasn't going t' be sick any more."

"So when the chills abated, the allergic attack was basically over."

"Yes. I'd say that was it."

"Now ma'am, if you'll excuse me, there are one or two details..."

On the way back to Snape's house, Robards was more skeptical. "Wizards and witches don't have allergies."

"Do you think she's lying?"

"That old woman? She's as innocent as the day is long. I don't think she understands the word `lie.'"

"You'd better be respectful, because `that old woman' has taken care of me since before I knew I was a wizard. Though you're right about her honesty."

Robards stopped right there in the street and regarded Snape with some interest. "I don't usually think of wizards as growing up in muggle communities. You mean everyone here knows you, what you are?"

"They know me, but they know me as a person, not as a wizard. They knew my mother and father. I think Mum and I were the only wizard folk here, but no one knows about that part of it. At least I don't think they do. There's a village east of here where my grandmother lived, and they knew she was a witch. She was the local healer."

Robards shook his head in wonder. "I guess some of the old tales about this country are true." He didn't elaborate on what those tales might be. "The point being, however, that whatever Mrs. Hanson's allergy may be, witches and wizards don't have them."

"How do you explain that the symptoms are identical, right down to the period of time after eating oysters? And remember, Dr. Carmichael is muggle-born." Snape got some satisfaction out of seeing Robards pause to reflect on that bit of information.

"You have a point. She isn't pureblood, and that might make a difference. I'll check with St. Mungo's. I might be visiting Hogwarts in the near future."

"I'd appreciate it if you'd wait until Easter break was over."

Nothing else of moment happened for the rest of the break. Snape read, worked on potions, experimented with cooking and asked Mrs. Hanson to dinner. He collected plants specimens and got marginally better at darts. The holiday was over far too soon.&#13;
