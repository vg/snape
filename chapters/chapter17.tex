\subsection{Chapter 17: Chapter 17 â€“ Misunderstandings}

\textbf{A Difference in the Family: The Sixth Year - Misunderstandings}

\emph{Wednesday, September 1, 1976 (the first quarter)}

This time on the Express, Severus arrived and boarded early, not wanting to see or be seen by anyone. Bella and Rodolphus, of course, were not there, having finished seventh year and left the school for good. Severus doubted anyone else would come looking for him. He settled at the rear of the train and watched the scenery.

Once at Hogwarts, it was impossible to avoid the others. Severus was a little worried about meeting his house mates again after the intense embarrassment of his humiliation at the hands of James and Sirius, but it turned out that what people remembered was the fight, and he was greeted almost as a returning hero. All during the Sorting and the welcoming feast, Severus tried to stay out of conversations with the others. He wondered if Lily would even notice.

The next day was Thursday and their first Potions class of the year. This time Severus left a note in Lily's book - `Lake. After supper. Please.' He was so nervous that he couldn't eat anything and left early to wait down by the water. He waited for two hours, but Lily didn't come.

Severus tried again on Friday with a note in Herbology. Once again, Lily ignored him. He wanted to talk to her on the weekend, but she spent most of her time in the Gryffindor common room, and when she went out into the school, she was always surrounded by friends. Meanwhile, Severus was talking to his dorm mates in monosyllables, if at all, and generally alienating everyone around him.

Sunday night, in defiance of both curfew and the bullies of Gryffindor, Severus went up to the seventh floor and sat in the corridor right in front of the picture of the Fat Lady. It was so late in the evening that the move was almost counterproductive, but fortunately Lily's dorm mates Dearborn and Macdonald were equally late.

"What are you doing here, Slytherin?" Dearborn sneered at him.

"Could you tell Evans I'm out here? I need to talk to her."

"Why don't I tell someone else you're out here and let them slap you around like they did last June?" Dearborn spat at him. "Snivellus," she added for good measure.

"You go right ahead and do that," said Severus. "Maybe it'll lure her out to watch the fun. Two beating up on one. That is Gryffindor's idea of `fun,' right?" To Macdonald he added, "Tell her I'll stay out here all night if necessary."

The two girls whispered the password to the Fat Lady and stalked past him into Gryffindor house, but apparently something got through because Lily appeared a few minutes later in pajamas and dressing gown.

Severus scrambled to his feet. "Lily, please. I need to talk to you. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry..."

"I'm not interested."

"I'm sorry!"

Lily folded her arms across her chest as if barricading herself from him. "Save your breath. I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here."

"I was. I would have done." Severus was talking fast, realizing that Lily didn't intend to stay. "I never meant to call you mudblood, it just..."

She refused to let him explain. "Slipped out? It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends..." Severus opened his mouth, but she cut him off. "You see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?"

Severus opened his mouth again, but was too shocked to reply. She'd already made up her mind, and wasn't going to listen.

She lashed out again. "I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine."

It was irrevocable dismissal. "No..." Severus stammered, "listen, I didn't mean..."

"...to call me mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?" And then she was gone back through the portrait into Gryffindor house.

Severus, standing there staring at the portrait entrance, felt white-hot rage rising in him. She hadn't let him complete one sentence, one explanation. Instead of finding out what he really wanted to say, she'd interrupted him again and again and supplied her own stupid, prejudiced answers. And, typical Gryffindor that she was, she was probably dumb enough to think that what she'd invented herself was what he'd really come up here to tell her. Why he'd ever thought that such a vicious, vain, cruel, irrational, prejudiced person was nice was beyond him.

A new kind of battle took place on Monday. Severus hadn't planned it, but he and Rosier were standing in the entrance hall when Lily and her friends came to breakfast. On a sudden impulse, Severus raised his voice. "You know how you get into Gryffindor, Evan? The Sorting Hat tests your intelligence. If your IQ is lower than your age, you're in Gryffindor."

Rosier snorted, then realized what was happening and went for extra points. "I thought you had a friend in Gryffindor."

"That's only because my parents wouldn't let me have a pet. If I'd had a goldfish or a turtle, I wouldn't have needed a Gryffindor. Turtles are much better companions, you know."

Lily and her friends marched by as if they hadn't heard, and Severus didn't press the point there. Later that morning in Herbology, however, he noticed that Alderton was at a table next to Lily. He walked over and ostentatiously moved Alderton's belongings to the side of her table farthest from Lily. "You need to be careful, Mina," he said. "Things can get stolen if you don't watch out." He didn't look at Lily then, but a glance later showed him her face was flushed, and she was cutting roots with a savage determination.

The third opportunity came outside Charms class. This time Severus was with Mulciber. "Al," he said in that slightly louder than necessary voice, "how can you tell a Gryffindor girl from a cobra?"

Mulciber laughed. "I don't know, Sev. How do you tell?"

"Easy. Get them to bite each other. The one that dies first is the cobra."

Going in to supper, Severus found himself face to face with Macdonald. "She wants to see you," was the message. "She says you know where."

Severus almost didn't go, but in the end curiosity got the better of him. Lily was already there, sitting on her rock, staring out across the water.

"I'm here." Severus said flatly.

Lily didn't turn around. "I want to know why you're being so mean."

"I thought I was remarkably restrained."

"You've been saying nasty things all day."

"You were pretty nasty to me last night."

"You just came to make excuses."

"How do you know, since you never let me get a word in edgewise?"

"I had a reason. I was angry. I'm still angry. Last year you called me a... you know."

"Considering what I could've called you, I still think I was remarkably restrained."

"I was trying to help you!"

"Why? Guilty conscience?"

"What are you talking about?" Lily was looking at him now.

"I thought maybe since you were teaching him all my spells you might feel guilty when he started using them on me."

"I told you. I keep telling you. I never taught him your spell."

"That's not what Potter says."

Lily blanched and paused. When she spoke again, her voice was nearly a whisper. "What did he say?"

"How you tried to teach him Levicorpus, but you were mispronouncing it, so you had to check with me about what you were doing wrong. He even told me how you were saying it."

"That's not true."

"Then how did he know?"

Lily had no answer to that, but she was determined to find one.

"Hey, Evans!"

Lily kept walking, and James hurried to catch up to her. "I was wondering if you'd like to go into Hogsmeade with me on the first weekend. I know it's weeks away, but I wanted to be the first to ask."

"I don't date liars."

James frowned. "I'm not a liar."

"No? Did you or did you not tell a friend of mine that I was passing you his spells?"

"Snivellus? You're worried about old Snivelly?"

"You did, didn't you? See. Liar."

"You know, I don't have to put up with this. There are other girls who'd be happy to date me."

"Good. Then you can stop bothering me."

"Well good riddance then," snapped Sirius that evening in their dormitory. "Ask somebody else. She doesn't deserve you."

"I don't want to ask anybody else. All I wanted to do was break them up, and now she hates me. What does she see in him, anyway?"

"Can you imagine her kissing him? His long hair getting in the way."

James threw a shoe at Sirius's head. "You're positively vile, you know!"

"I know how to capture her affections. Take a telescope. I hear you can do really kinky things with a telescope."

James stomped out of the dormitory, through the common room and past the Fat Lady, fuming and calling Sirius every name he could think of under his breath. He wished he could start over with Lily with a clean slate, but he'd bungled that relationship royally. Sirius was probably right, he should give up on Lily and date other girls. The problem was, he didn't want to date other girls. He wanted to date Lily.

On the last Saturday in September, the Marauder's Map in hand, James went looking for Severus.

It took a while for James to find Severus in a spot where there were no other students. The little dot labeled `Severus Snape' stayed on the fourth floor in the library for nearly three hours while James waited in one of the corridors. Luckily most of the students were outside enjoying the fall weather, so when Severus finally left the library, the fourth floor was almost deserted.

"Hey, Snape!" James called as he hurried forward.

Instantly, Severus had his wand in his hand and his back to the wall, glancing quickly up and down the corridor for Sirius, Remus, and Peter. It was a reaction that would have amused James a month earlier, but now only made him angrier with himself for being such a miscalculating fool.

"I need to talk to you."

"Where's your backup?"

"I don't need backup. I can handle you myself."

"You think so? You never have before."

James held his hands up in front of him, palms open. "No wand. No backup. I just want to talk."

"In an empty fourth-floor corridor with no witnesses."

"You're not making this easy!"

"Right. I'm supposed to make your life easy."

James took a deep breath. "I just wanted to tell you that I lied to you. About Evans."

Severus eyed him narrowly. "Did Lily put you up to this?"

"She doesn't know anything about it. But she won't talk to me." James stopped. It was more than he wanted to say, certainly to Severus.

"Sounds like evidence of common sense to me."

"Look, I overheard you talking to her about your spells, and I pretended that she told me herself. I wanted to break you up."

"Now you are lying. You couldn't have overheard that. If you'd gotten close enough to hear, I'd have seen you. Lily put you up to this. Maybe you can tell me why."

"No. She doesn't know."

"Okay. You stick to that story." Severus inched away from the wall and backed down the corridor, his wand still out and ready to fight if James made a move.

James just wanted to bang his head against the wall.

It was shortly after his encounter with James that Severus remembered what had attracted his attention during the OWL exam the previous June. It was Question 10: `Give five signs that identify the werewolf.' He'd been thinking about the full moon, and that had led to Remus's mysterious illnesses that lasted for about three days every month. Always around the time of the full moon.

Of course, the idea of Remus Lupin being a werewolf was ridiculous. If there'd been a werewolf at Hogwarts for the past five years, everyone would've known it. There'd have been attacks and deaths, and Lupin would have been discovered. No, the answer was something else, but it was connected with the moon. Severus decided that he was going to find out what it was.

In addition, Severus thought he might keep a closer eye on James and Lily. It bothered him that Lily would get James to confess to a lie when the confession was so obviously false. It was even more unnerving that James would actually pretend to apologize to him. There had to be something behind it, and knowing James, it boded no good for Severus Snape. He wished that Lily was not involved.

\emph{Thursday, October 7, 1976 (the full moon)}

Remus wasn't in Potions, but then Severus hadn't expected him to be. All that afternoon he tried to keep at least one of the other three in sight, figuring that at some point they'd want to be with their sick friend.

"There he is again," snarled Sirius, looking over the Marauder's Map. "Right up there by the first floor windows. Just standing there looking out."

James shifted his position so that he was facing both Sirius and the castle. Sure enough, Severus was at one of the windows watching them. Then he was gone.

"Now he's coming down the stairs. He'll be at the entrance in a few seconds." Sirius tucked the map inside his robes. It wouldn't do to have other people get curious.

"We've got to distract him," said James, "send him off someplace else. We have to shake him before we can join Remus."

"I think we should take him with us. Then he'd never bother us again."

"Stop talking like an idiot." Then James brightened. "I have an idea. Give me the map. When you see him follow me, get to the willow."

The little dot labeled `Lily Evans' was in the fountain courtyard. James set off down the lawn toward the lake, planning to double back and join her there. If all went well, he could kill two birds with one stone. Sure enough, after a minute the dot labeled `Severus Snape' began to follow him while Sirius and Peter continued in the other direction toward the willow.

Lily was sitting on a bench studying her Advanced Potions book. James took a deep breath and walked over to her. "Hey there, Evans. Can I join you?"

The look on her face was pure disgust. "I'm studying," she said.

James sat on the wall next to the bench instead of on the bench itself. Out of the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of black and green moving in the cloistered walk and knew Severus was there. "I just wanted you to know I tried," he said, a touch louder than he normally would.

"Tried what?"

"Patching things up with old Snivellus..."

"You are a toad! Why do you call him that? He has a name."

"You called him that."

"I was angry."

"Okay. Okay. Snape. I tried patching things up with Snape. It didn't work."

"What did you do? Lie to him and insult him again?"

"No! I tried telling him the truth... that I'd overheard you. He didn't believe me. He didn't think I could get that close."

"Come to think of it, I don't believe you either. We were out by the forest and there wasn't anyone around. How did you hear us?"

James thought fast. "It's a spell that enhances your hearing. It's like having an ear trumpet or a microphone."

"I don't believe you."

"So don't believe me. But I tried. You can ask him yourself."

"He won't talk to me and it's your fault. And I hate you. Go away."

James got up and left. Once on the lawn he took out the map. Severus wasn't following him anymore, he was headed for the lake. Lily was still sitting in the courtyard. James grinned. His plan had worked better than he'd hoped. With a much lighter heart he headed for the willow to join his friends.

Severus spent a long time by the lake, skipping stones across the water and pondering what he'd heard. It made no sense. He tried to reason out scenarios.

First he focused on the assumption that both James and Lily were telling the truth. That would mean that James overheard them talking, and Lily was unaware of it. This was the most comfortable explanation, but it had one major flaw. There was no such spell as the one James described. Not that people hadn't tried to make one. If such a spell existed, no secrets would be safe from anyone, for the distance that James claimed to be able to eavesdrop was at least two hundred yards. It would be the most coveted, sought after, and therefore most well-known spell in the wizarding world.

Then there was the possibility that both James and Lily were lying, and that Lily had given James the spells. It was simple, easy to understand given that Severus knew Lily was attracted to James, and personally very unpleasant. What it meant, though, was that the scene he'd just witnessed had been concocted by both for the purpose of misleading him. Severus didn't like this scenario at all, not least because he was sure that Lily was not that good an actress.

If James were lying and Lily truthful, there was still the problem of how he'd overheard a distant conversation, and the proposition that James was truthful and Lily lying just didn't make sense. There was always Lily's explanation - that she'd talked in her sleep - but then why would James have to make up a story about nonexistent spells?

No matter which way he looked at it, Severus could see nothing but a puzzle wrapped in contradictions.

The puzzle, and classes, kept Severus busy through the second night of the full moon, and then there was nothing to do but wait another month. He had a lot now to keep him busy. Seventh years were approaching him about tutoring for their NEWTs and fifth years about their OWLs. He had so many requests from timorous first and second years that he actually set up a little workshop where they could review and practice the material they covered each week. Slytherin house was doing very well in Potions.

Severus was doing very well in money, the only problem being that it was all galleons, sickles, and knuts. Then he hit on the idea of charging only two-thirds the fee if he were paid in Muggle money. Half-blood students were overjoyed, and purebloods so desperate that a black market in pounds and pence soon darkened the seedy teenage underbelly of Hogwarts. Or at least of Slytherin house.

Then Gra's house was sold, and Nana sent an owl to inform Severus that he now had an actual bank account with Barclay's of London. He had to go with her to sign a sheaf of papers, but the wonder of possessing a number and a passbook was something that enveloped him in a fluffy cloud of contentment for days.

\emph{Saturday, November 6, 1976 (the full moon)}

The next full moon fell on a weekend. By great good or ill fortune, it was also a weekend when the school was allowed to visit Hogsmeade. This time Severus decided to go. This time he had money. Though most of the students talked about Honeydukes and the taverns and coffee shops, Severus knew that Hogsmeade also boasted a book store.

The sun was heading toward an early setting that afternoon, but not before the full moon rose in the deepening late afternoon sky. Severus was immersed in books, from which pleasant occupation he was summoned by screams and yells. "The Shack! The Shack is shrieking!"

Severus raced out with the others. To be a witness to the phenomenon of the most haunted spot in Britain not just once, but twice, was an opportunity not to be missed. Pressed together with the other students at a respectful distance, Severus listened again to the cries and moans of the Shack, punctuated with howls and ululations impossible to describe. The crowd cheered and shivered at the spectral sounds, and went back to Hogwarts thoroughly pleased with the day's activities.

A little later, Severus stood on the lawn in front of the castle watching the bright orb of the moon rise in the sky. The moon was full, Lupin was sick, and the Shack was shrieking. \emph{I never thought about it before because I never went into Hogsmeade before except that one time. Does the Shack only shriek when the moon is full? And what would it have to do with Remus Lupin?}

The December full moon coincided with end of term exams, and Christmas break was full of workshops and Potions classes. The January full moon was wrapped up in beginning of term papers and assignments. Severus's daily schedule had never been so full, and he was beginning to wonder if the money was worth it. He barely had time to even think of his problems with Lily. They probably wouldn't have had time to speak even if they'd been on speaking terms.

Then January was over and the term settled in, and Severus had a chance to breathe. It was the beginning of February, Imbolc in the ancient way on the first, Candlemas in the Son's way on the second, and by great coincidence the first night of the full moon on the third. Severus thought again of the mysterious illness of Remus Lupin and decided to investigate once more.

James, meanwhile, had continued his relentless pursuit of Lily. He greeted her, consulted her, mugged in front of her and made her giggle, embarrassed himself for her pleasure and allowed her to insult him at her whim. In short, he would have been the perfect boyfriend if she had liked him even a little. As it was, he endured perpetual frustration for a shining goal held always beyond his reach.

Christmas break brought Sirius to the haven of the Potter household, but Sirius was no help because he never looked beyond the throng of Quidditch groupies. James longed for the days when Lily could trample his heart underfoot, and was eager for the new term to begin.

\emph{Thursday, February 3, 1977 (the day before the full moon)}

Sirius stared at the Marauder's Map in disgust. "Snivellus is following us again. Why can't he keep his greasy nose out of our business?"

"Leave him alone." James was watching the spiral staircase leading from the Gryffindor common room to the girls' dormitories where Lily had just disappeared. It was after supper, and they were waiting until the room cleared to sneak out. "Besides, how can he be following us when we're in here?"

"He's outside waiting near the entrance steps. I think he wants to find Remus. I think he wants to get Remus expelled."

"You're paranoid. He doesn't know anything about Remus."

"No? How come he only follows us once a month? Answer that, Mr. Know-It-All. I'm going out to have a talk with him."

James was on his feet in an instant. "You're not going to mess with him."

"Why? Because he's your girlfriend's pet? What's she going to do, beat you up?"

"I'm serious. You're not going to hurt him."

"I'm Sirius, too. And I promise I won't lay a hand on him."

Sirius returned twenty minutes later looking like the cat that had swallowed the cream. "That's it," he said. "Trouble over."

James glanced over at him. "How'd you get rid of him?"

"Told him what he wanted to know."

"Which was..." The room had grown suddenly cold.

"I told him how to find Remus, but he thinks he's after you, too." Sirius laughed. "I said I was sick of you hanging around Lily, and that you and Remus had a secret place outside Hogwarts. I told him about the willow and the knot. I said it'd be a good thing if he caught you two together because then you'd both be expelled for going off grounds. Then you wouldn't be able to bother Lily."

"And he believed you?"

"No. Of course not. He told me what an idiot I was. I was that close to strangling him. But I think his curiosity is going to get the better of him and we'll be rid of a nuisance."

James felt his heart stop. "You sent him into that tunnel without telling him what he'd be meeting?"

"So? Serves him right for being such a nosey Parker."

"No. Curiosity doesn't deserve death. You're going to stop it."

"Hell if I am. If I could have a front row seat, I'd be in it."

There was no time to lose, and James was on his feet and out the door before Sirius finished the sentence.

As soon as Sirius went back into the Castle, Severus started down the hill toward the willow. He'd wondered about that tree. The older students remembered when it was brought in, already substantial, and planted. That was the year before Severus entered Hogwarts. Why anyone would want a whomping willow around a school was a mystery. Yet somehow Sirius Black had the key to that mystery, and it involved Remus and James. Unless, of course, there was no button, and Sirius was watching from the hill, waiting for Severus to get whomped.

\emph{Timing. It's all timing. If I can dart in and back out again before it has a chance to hit me...} Severus took a deep breath and ran for a great root that arched out like the entrance to a cave before plunging into the earth. The willow reared back in anger, but Severus already found and pushed the knot, and the tree froze. \emph{Amazing. Sirius Black was telling the truth.}

Under the root was a low, rough tunnel leading in the direction of Hogsmeade. Behind Severus the full moon lit the school grounds with bright silver light, but the tunnel was pitch black. Severus drew his wand. "Lumos," he said, and entered the tunnel.

James ran out across the lawn to where he could look down on the whomping willow. It stood immobile. \emph{Let me be on time. Please let me be on time.} He raced down the hill and ducked into the tunnel. \emph{I can't even transform. I have to talk to him, and I may have to use magic. I have to face Remus as a human.}

James lit his own Lumos spell and hurried as quickly as he could along the low, uneven tunnel, reasoning that he could gain on Severus since he knew his way already. And yet there was no black-robed student in front of him, no twin light spell. James dreaded what he might find at the end of that tunnel and felt sick.

Then the tunnel rose, and James pulled himself up into a lower room of the Shrieking Shack. The door to the hallway was ajar. Beyond it he heard quiet footsteps, and a board creaked. Then there was the horrible sound of ripping, splintering wood, and a crash that made the whole house shake.

James burst through the door to find Severus frozen at the foot of the stairs, his face blank with shock, staring up into the yellow eyes of a huge, raging werewolf. The beast leaped.

James screamed, "MOVE!" and threw himself forward, tackling Severus and pulling him down away from the wolf's claws. Twisting himself around, he shoved his wand forward and yelled, "Impedimenta!" The wolf staggered back, dazed, and James jumped to his feet, pulling on Severus's arm. "Get up! Get up! We have to get out of here!"

Severus scrambled up, but the wolf was between the two boys and the hallway door. The Impedimenta was already wearing off. Severus pointed his own wand, a determined look on his face, and James, realizing what he was about to do, grabbed his arm. "Don't kill him! It's Remus!" The wolf charged, and the boys dove for the floor.

The door was in front of James now. He wheeled and sent another spell at the wolf, giving Severus time to get clear, but the second spell had less effect than the first one. After reeling for a moment, the wolf faced them, teeth bared and snarling, and started down the hallway.

"On three! One, two, thr..." Twin Impedimenta spells hit the werewolf, and James and Severus bolted through the door and slammed it shut. "Down into the tunnel! Quick! It can't follow us. It's too big."

"What about you?' Severus gasped. The wolf was clawing at the door, which couldn't hold long.

"I'll be right behind you. Move!"

Severus slipped down the hole with James on top of him as the werewolf broke through the door and thrust its snout into the tunnel after them. They ran, bent over, stumbling and tripping on the uneven floor, until they were certain there was no wolf behind them, then lit their wands and continued, bathed in the dim green light, to the base of the willow .

There, under the willow, they sat panting and gasping for breath. Severus was trembling uncontrollably, and James realized that he was shaking, too. They looked at each other, then Severus said in a tight, fierce voice, "He tried to kill me."

"He can't help it when he's changed. He doesn't know what he's doing."

"Not him. Black. Black tried to kill me. I'm going to get him. I swear I'm going to get him."

"Can't we please stop the fighting?"

"I wasn't the one who started it."

"Fine. But we don't have to fight tonight. Let's get out of here."

James led the way out of the willow and pushed the knot to let them through. The two walked back up the hill in silence. As they split up, Severus to go down into Slytherin house and James up into Gryffindor, Severus turned. "By the way," he said, "thank you. For saving my life."

"Don't mention it."

Neither boy slept well that night.

After the full moon passed, Sirius greeted Remus like a conquering hero. "You had old Snivellus messing his pants. I'd've loved to see it. Gad, what a show."

Remus shook his head. "I don't understand what you're talking about."

"Sit down," James told him. "This isn't going to be easy to listen to. And you, Padfoot, keep your mouth shut. Snape was following us. He figured out something was wrong, but not what. Sirius thought it would be `funny' to tell him how to get past the whomping willow and into the tunnel. Told him you and I were visiting Hogsmeade without permission."

"But he didn't do it. You didn't really let him do it."

"When I got there, you and he were facing off at opposite ends of the staircase. If I'd gotten there ten seconds later, you'd have killed him. He had a chance to kill you, too, but when I asked him not to, he didn't"

Remus blanched and looked nauseous. "I've never killed anyone. All these years I've been so lucky, and I've never killed anyone. And then you!" He rounded on Sirius with an anger they'd never seen him display before. "You send someone walking right in where you know I'll have to kill him..."

"So what? It was just old Snivelly."

"Shut up!" James and Remus yelled at him in unison.

Severus sat at the far end of the Slytherin table during supper and kept his eyes on the Gryffindor four. He hadn't yet mentioned his encounter with Remus to anyone else, though he'd been weighing the pros and cons. Finished eating, he rose and left for Slytherin house. The four rose as well and followed him out.

Severus knew they were there. Halfway across the entrance hall, he turned to face them. "Isn't this a little public?" he said. "But I forgot. You like public places."

James planted himself directly in Sirius's path. "This has nothing to do with us," he said. "We're staying here. This is just about you and Remus."

Remus separated himself from the others. "I need to talk to you. Can we go outside?"

They went out onto the lawn where the moon was climbing in the east. Remus watched it wistfully, then said, "I want to apologize to you."

"What for?"

"For what happened."

"Which time?"

Remus was puzzled. "How many times did you go to the Shack?"

"Ah, that one. That's the one you don't have to apologize for. That wasn't your fault."

"I could have killed you."

"No. The werewolf could have killed me. I did get an Outstanding in Dark Arts, you know."

"So what other one are you talking about."

"Ones. Plural. The first one was having my arms held while they took my wand away from me, dragged me into an empty room, and forced slug juice down my throat."

"I wasn't in the room."

"You helped carry me to Slytherin house afterward and left me there paralyzed. The last one was watching a Gryffindor prefect sit quietly on the grass while I was drowning in soapsuds. There were others in between, but those two stand out."

"You're not making this easy."

"Why does everyone expect me to make things easy for them when they've made things so hard for me? Frankly, if I had to choose between apologizing and vomiting slugs, I'd much rather apologize."

"You hit us, too."

"Never four to one. Not even two to one."

Remus didn't know what to say. He was suddenly very tired. "Look," he said, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all of it. You're right. I'm weak and I went along with it. I'd give anything to be able to go back and undo it, but I can't. I know we can't ever be friends, but could we at least be not enemies?"

"Are you speaking just for yourself?"

"Just for myself."

"Okay. Not enemies."

On an impulse, Remus stretched out his hand. "Pax?" he asked.

Severus hesitated, his cold eyes glittering in the moonlight. Then he took Remus's hand very briefly. "Pax," he replied.

"Let's walk," James said as Remus rejoined them and the four started up the stairs to Gryffindor house. "Just us." He called to Sirius, who was up on the second flight already. "Remus and I are going out. We'll meet you later in the common room."

The two went back out onto the lawn under the moon. "How did it go?"

Remus thought for a moment. "Better than I deserve. He's awfully bitter. Not that I blame him. But he agreed not to be enemies."

"So we're neutral now?"

"Not you. Just me. I don't think it'll be so easy for you."

"No, guess not. But he did agree to end hostilities with you? That's encouraging."

"Good luck."

"I'll need it."

James was sitting in the common room, the Marauder's Map secreted in the book he pretended to read and an unusually light book bag on the floor next to him. When the `Severus Snape' dot started moving through the Slytherin common room, he was up and running down from Gryffindor Tower, the bag in hand.

They met in the entrance hall. "I need to talk to you," James said between breaths. "How about in here?" He gestured to the room where the first years waited for sorting.

"I don't like that room," Severus said.

James nodded. "I don't blame you." Then, on an impulse, he reached inside his robes and took out his wand. Holding it by the tip, he offered it to Severus. "Token of good faith?" he said.

Severus took the wand. "You first?"

They entered the room, James first and Severus after. James turned, determined to see this through. "I'm putting all my cards on the table," he said.

"I don't play cards," Severus responded.

"You know, you're not..."

"Making this easy. Yes, I know."

James took a deep breath. "I like Evans. I think she could like me, but she seems to think I'm a stuck-up prick."

Severus raised his eyebrows.

"Okay! I am a stuck-up prick! But she's angry that you won't talk to her and she thinks it's my fault. And it is my fault. So I'm going to come clean." James reached into his book bag and pulled out the length of shimmering, iridescent fabric. "I got this for Christmas last year." He threw it over his shoulders, and most of his body instantly disappeared.

Severus didn't gasp, but his mouth stayed open for a good five seconds. "You have an Invisibility Cloak."

"Not really. It's just this old rag that coincidentally makes you disappear."

Severus's cough concealed a snort of laughter. The laughter was a reflex of relief. He sat down in one of the chairs. "So you wore this... thing, and followed us?"

"Right out to the edge of the Forbidden Forest. She talked about not being able to do the spell. You told her what she was doing wrong. I spread it through the whole school the next day."

Severus stood and walked over to James. Slowly, carefully, he reached out and touched the fabric of the cloak. "Do you know how rare these are?"

"Not really. My parents gave it to me. Family heirloom or something. Look, do you think you could patch things up with Lily? I know you don't like the idea of us being together, but it's only leveling the playing field. If she still doesn't like me, I'm cooked."

"I'll talk to Lily," Severus said.

The note, `Lake - after supper,' appeared in Lily's book this time.

Lily was early, Severus on time. "What did you want?" Lily asked, cutting right to the important part.

"I had a talk with Potter today."

"Oh. What did he have to say?"

"It turns out he owns an Invisibility Cloak. He got it for Christmas a year ago."

"Do they exist?"

"This one does. He showed it to me. He thinks every rich kid has one. In his dictionary, rare and expensive are synonyms."

There was an awkward silence, Lily not wanting to ask and Severus not wanting to volunteer. Severus buckled first. "He wore it that evening when he overheard us talking."

"So I didn't tell him."

"I guess not." There was another awkward silence while Severus weighed the relative discomfort of spitting up slugs. "I... eh... was wrong. I... should have trusted you. I'm sorry."

"That's okay. An invisibility cloak. Wow. Who would have guessed?"

"So, how are your classes going?"

"Same as usual. Potions is getting hard. It's so easy to brew them, but analyzing them is a lot harder. I still don't understand Golpalott."

"Well, if you need any help..."

They didn't stay. It was cold, and it was late. Both had early classes, and there really wasn't much else to talk about.

The next day James approached Lily and timidly tried to clown for her amusement. She smiled at him, and he grinned back.

Potions was a bigger nightmare for Lily than she admitted. She'd always been good, and working with Severus had made her top in her class, but brewing and analyzing were totally different concepts, not to mention the academic theories, and Lily was floundering.

During the last class of February, Slughorn gave them the hardest assignment yet, which was the practical application of Golpalott's Third Law. Each student was given a different blended poison and required, during the course of one double period, to analyze it and come up with the antidote that would simultaneously counteract each of the poison's separate components. Severus wasn't concerned. The work was rigorous and challenging, but eminently doable. He set out calmly and methodically to uncover the secrets of his poison.

Lily was having trouble. She botched her first test and had to start over again. Then she mismeasured a vital catalytic agent and ended up with skewed results. Time was running out, and Lily was nowhere near finished.

Severus, who'd been immersed in his own work, didn't notice her panic until the class was nearly done, and Lily hadn't wanted to ask him. Their relationship was still too tenuous. He completed his assignment and looked over at her, frustrated and frazzled. Their eyes met, Severus realized what was happening and inclined his head toward his potions book, then bent and scribbled a few words.

When Slughorn wasn't looking, Lily crept over to Severus's table on the pretext of picking up more ingredients. Glancing at the page in the book, she saw written right across a list of antidotes the words \emph{Just shove a bezoar down their throats.} Almost laughing with relief, she slipped across the room to a storage cupboard and returned a moment later with something clutched tightly in her hand. When Slughorn came to check her results and look at her antidote, she held the bezoar in front of him.

Slughorn roared with laughter. "Not exactly the solution I was expecting, Evans, but I do have to give you points for creativity."

Across the room, Lily and Severus winked at each other. For that brief moment, they were a team again.

In March it was announced that apparating lessons would begin within the week. All students who had already turned seventeen, or who would turn seventeen before the first of April, were allowed to sign up. Both Lily and Severus put their names in the first day.

Hagrid looked up from the raked and hoed plot that by autumn would become a pumpkin patch. "Hullo. Haven't seen you in a while. Y're looking reasonably fit. What're ya now, seventeen?"

"Reasonably fit," said Severus. "I suppose that's better than `at death's door,' though there is that touch of something lacking. And yes, I have managed to survive until age seventeen. How've you been doing, Hagrid?"

"'Bout the same as always. There ain't a lot of variety in the job from year t' year. New students, new faces, same problems."

"Same old same old, I suppose. Well, Dumbledore said I should now have a checkup once a year. I think this is it, if you're not too busy."

"Won't be in about fifteen minutes. Have a seat, lad. I hear y're learning t' apparate." Hagrid bent to his seeding.

"Oh, yes. Wonderful thing, Apparation. No more train tickets and overnights in London. And I can now do magic at home without ministerial interference."

"You got somewhat you want t' do at home?"

"Little things. Improvement projects. Muggle awareness protection. Do you know that last summer I made bookcases? With a hammer and nails? I am not a carpenter."

Hagrid chuckled. "It ain't in all of us t' be handy, lad."

They went into the hut, and Hagrid checked height, weight, teeth, reflexes... Severus endured it all with patience.

"One of your jobs is managing the forest, isn't it?" Severus said as Hagrid peered into his right ear.

"Yep. And it's a full-time job on its own, it is. That's a big piece of property."

"So you've got to notice if things go wrong, like strange animals move into the area."

"Sure enough. Upset the balance, they do."

"Then if some big predator animal moved in, like a wolf, you'd be the first to have to deal with it."

"I would. Though we ain't had that problem since the winter of '54."

"No wolves at all?"

Hagrid paused. His face scrunched up in thought. "Can't say as there's been any at all. Can't say as I've seen any."

"Of course not. There wouldn't be any wolves around Hogwarts."

Later that afternoon, long after Severus had gone, Hagrid went to Dumbledore. "He's asking about wolves on the grounds."

"Dear, dear, we must see about that," was Dumbledore's response.

Dumbledore regarded the earnest student with some affection. "So you see, the whole situation has been under control for some years."

"And you can guarantee that there's never been a time when he's left that shack. Never even a close call?"

"Is there some reason, Master Snape, that you feel that you are better qualified than I to evaluate this situation? If so, I would appreciate hearing it, for I would not wish to make an error in so delicate a matter."

"No, sir."

"And do you have any concrete evidence that other students are in any way endangered?"

"No, sir."

"Ah. Then I shall have to request that you keep your suspicions to yourself. As long as you are unable or unwilling to back them up with factual evidence, then I must insist on maintaining the status quo. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir."

Sirius Black stopped Severus on the third floor the next day, as Severus was going down from the library. "You peached to Dumbledore, didn't you?"

"Why, Black. Whatever are you talking about?"

"He had us up there for half an hour. I'm on detention. You're a little sneak squealer, and I won't forget it."

"You know, Black, you keep jumping to conclusions, and one day you're going to jump right off a cliff."

"I won't forget. I've got my eye on you."

"Oh, I'm scared, I'm scared. Look how I'm trembling."

Black stomped off, and Severus waited until his next Potions class to speak to Lily. The conversation was whispered, but that didn't disguise Lily's irritation.

"I think it's mean of you to talk about Remus that way. Think what would happen if that rumor started in the school. He wouldn't have any friends at all. And you're wrong. He just gets sick a lot."

"Sick only when the moon is full, and I bet you wouldn't find him in the hospital wing. And he wouldn't lose any friends because his friends already know. I don't want to start rumors, Lily, but I don't want you hurt either. You've got to be careful."

"He's been here nearly six full years. Nothing's happened, not even the rumor of anything happening. Sev, I think you're wrong."

Their eyes met for the first time in more than a year, and Severus felt the barriers melt and the doors swing open in his brain. For a second, just a second, he let it happen. Then he turned his gaze away. "Why can't we be friends again," he said quietly, "like we were before?"

Lily was suddenly engrossed in the potion she was brewing. "I don't know," she said. "Could we both forget what's happened? You've changed." She must have noticed the suddenly stiffening of his back and shoulders because she added, "We've both changed. We're not children anymore. We're not the same people we were then. You have other... friends, and so do I."

"They're not my friends. They tolerate me. I use them. I've only ever had one..." Now it was Severus who found the potion in his cauldron fascinating. After a minute, he whispered, "Couldn't we try? We were best friends once."

"I don't know. Let me think about it."

On Mulciber's seventeenth birthday, Avery snuck a bottle of firewhisky into the sixth year dormitory. Now all five of them, Severus, Wilkes, Rosier, Edison, and Mulciber, were seventeen, but the firewhisky was still not allowed in the dormitory, and they were joined by the underage Regulus Black, so the whole party was technically illegal.

"Here's to the Birthday Boy!" Avery said as he thrust a glass of firewhisky into Severus's hand.

Severus looked down at the glistening amber liquid and thought of his father. He himself had never before tasted anything alcoholic, and he wondered if this would do to him what gin had done to his dad. He started to hand it back. "I don't know..." he said.

"Oh, come on. One small drink isn't going to hurt you. You have to toast the birthday boy. It's customary."

Severus kept the drink. The only one who was firm in sticking to pumpkin juice was Edison, who was now generally considered the prude of the dorm anyway.

Avery raised his glass. "Gentlemen, I give you Aloysius Mulciber!"

The other five, Edison with his pumpkin juice, raised their glasses and responded, "Aloysius Mulciber!" and downed their drinks. Severus had the impression even as he drained his glass, that Regulus had done this before, then he was suddenly and totally preoccupied with the burning sensation in his throat and stomach. He began to cough uncontrollably.

"There's always a first time," Wilkes laughed as he pounded Severus on the back. "Here, have another. It'll stop the coughing."

Wilkes was right. It did stop the coughing. In fact, the little party became quite merry after that, and Severus found himself giggling at just about everything Mulciber said because he realized that Mulciber was a very funny person. The boys started a little hexing game, trying to leave marks on each others' faces.

"I know!" cried Avery. "Let's go out into the castle and see what we can find!"

Edison declined, and he managed to convince Severus to stay as well and get Regulus to bed. If Regulus had been caught outside Slytherin house clearly tipsy, they all would have been in serious trouble.

Regulus was asleep and tucked into bed (in that order) well before curfew and the return of the other four boys. Severus was still in a state where he was highly amused at everything, but Edison was gradually pulling him back down to earth. Then Avery and the others came bursting into the common room with the air and noise of escaping a hue and cry, becoming more sedate once they were safely inside Slytherin, and finally sauntering into the dorm laughing.

"Did you see the look on her face?" Avery crowed. "I thought I'd die! Where'd you ever come up with that spell, Al?"

"A little thing I picked up at Zonkos's, though I doubt the originator intended it to be that... revealing," said Mulciber.

Wilkes was giggling like a maniac. "I thought she'd have a fit when she realized it was under her robes, but the unbuttoning charm... If only it'd gotten one more button. What a treat!"

"What are you talking about?" Edison asked.

"Girls!" Wilkes and Rosier yelped together, and Rosier continued. "We went up to the fifth floor and caught some Gryffindors and Ravenclaws going up to the towers, mostly half-breeds and mudbloods, including Ferguson." He made a motion over his chest to indicate how well-endowed Ferguson was. "Al has these disrobing spells..." He chuckled.

"I swear," howled Wilkes, "it was all the way down to here before she realized her robe was being unbuttoned. And lifting that Gryffindor's robes from behind 'til you could see... Whew!"

"And the tickling curse! You'd think she had a bee in her robes the way she was jumping around!"

"I didn't want her to jump around," laughed Mulciber. "I wanted her to take the robes off. Kind of like a birthday present to me."

"We could have, too," Rosier explained, "because Ken had them boxed in on the landing. He's got this herding spell, and where they were, no one could hear them. Another ten, fifteen minutes and - paradise!"

"What Gryffindor girls?" Severus asked giggling, his attention finally shifting from the general laughter to four comments earlier.

"The plump one," Avery said. "What's her name? Macdonald. She and Ferguson were the oldest there. The others were younger. They'd have put on a great show."

"Why didn't they?" Edison asked, quiet and calm. Of the group he was the only one who hadn't laughed.

"Oh, that," said Mulciber. "A group of Ravenclaw boys came by and saw what we were doing. We had to run. It was great fun, though."

The four continued to relive the incident to their own great amusement, and to Severus's as well, imitating, in a clownish way, the motions of the girls as they struggled to keep their clothing in place despite the disrobing spells. Then, suddenly, Severus was asleep, and didn't wake until the next morning, not really certain how he'd gotten into his own bed.

It wasn't until three days later that Severus noticed there was anything wrong. Lily had spent most of their afternoon Charms class working with Potter and Lupin, but Severus was hoping to talk to her alone during the afternoon break. He followed her discretely downstairs, and when she broke off from the others to head toward one of the courtyards, he called softly, "Lily, wait a moment." To his surprise, she tilted her nose up and stalked on as if she hadn't heard him.

"Lily! Lily, wait," Severus called again, with as little response. He caught up to her at the entrance to the cloistered walk. "Lily, is something wrong?"

She glared at him. "I don't want to talk to you," she stated firmly. "I hate the lot of you."

"Hate me? what did I do?"

"You're just like them."

"Like who?"

"Birds of a feather," Lily said flatly, and stomped past him into the courtyard.

Severus ran after her, his temper beginning to rise. "What are you talking about? You know, Lily, it might help if you explained to me what I did that made you angry. I'm not a mind reader, you know. Lily! I thought we were supposed to be friends? Best friends?"

Lily spun to face him, walking sideways, almost backwards, across the courtyard. "We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging around with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! Do you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?" She backed into a pillar and stopped there, scanning his face.

The memory was there - fuzzy, but there. "That was nothing," Severus said. "It was a laugh, that's all..." It had certainly seemed amusing while he was listening to it.

"It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny..."

Severus began to seethe, the demon rising in him. It was the same prejudice, the same double standard that Lily had been throwing at him ever since the Sorting Hat put her in Gryffindor. The double standard that Dumbledore and McGonagall encouraged. What his dorm mates had done hadn't actually hurt the girls, not like putting Bertram Aubrey in hospital or trying to suffocate Severus in soapsuds, or sending him to face a werewolf and almost certain death. But when Gryffindor did something, it was a boyish prank, and when Slytherin did something, usually something less serious, all of a sudden it was Dark Magic.

"What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?" he spat at her, jumping over the logic and going straight to the heart of the matter.

"What's Potter got to do with anything?" said Lily.

\emph{Everything. The different ruler you use when you measure Potter has everything to do with it.} The words didn't come out right, though, and Severus found himself beginning to stammer again as he listed the reasons she already knew. "They... sneak out at night. There's... something weird about that Lupin..." \emph{Like he's on page three-ninety-four of our third year Dark Arts text...} "Where does he keep going?" \emph{Think, Lily, think.}

"He's ill," said Lily, as if she were reciting a memorized passage. "They say he's ill..."

\emph{They! Potter and Black most likely!} "Every month at the full moon?" \emph{Remember what I told you!}

Lily was suddenly as cold as ice, distant, a stranger. "I know your theory. Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?"

\emph{Because you let them get away with murder. Because Dumbledore and McGonagall let them get away with murder. Because if you're rich and attractive and in the right clique, the whole world lets you get away with murder.} "I'm just trying to... show you they're not as... wonderful as everyone seems to... think they are."

"They don't use Dark Magic, though," Lily retorted, and before his response could explode on her, she let her voice drop to almost a whisper. "And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from what ever 's down there..."

Severus recoiled in livid shock. Dumbledore had forbidden him to speak of the incident, but he'd apparently placed no such restrictions on Potter, Black, or Lupin. "Saved?" he spluttered. "Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends' too!" He couldn't comprehend how she could be so unfair. "You're not going to..." he stammered. "I won't let you..."

Lily's fury blazed now. "Let me!" she screamed at him. "Let me!"

They glared at each other, and Severus felt the sluice gates rise as everything in him seemed to open and pour out. There had never been any doubt who in their relationship controlled whom, and he had never really questioned that it should be so. "I didn't mean..." He was stammering again. "I just don't want to... see you made a fool of..." He paused. \emph{Cards on the table. That's what Potter said.} "He fancies you, James Potter fancies you! And he's not... everyone thinks... big Quidditch hero..."

A look of surprise and then of comprehension illuminated Lily's face. She seized her advantage and held onto it. "I know James Potter's an arrogant toerag. I don't need you to tell me that. But Mulciber's and Avery's idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don't understand how you can be friends with them."

Severus relaxed into the sense of ease and peace that Lily's eyes always gave him. He had missed it for so long. Lily was there, talking to him, letting him look in her eyes, and what was more, she'd not yet succumbed to Potter. The world still held hope.

Lily moved away from the pillar, Severus beside her. "Will you stop seeing them, Sev? Can you do that?"

"It isn't that easy, Lil. We live together. We sleep in the same dorm. Well, not Avery, of course. Could you just stop talking to your dorm mates?"

"My dorm mates are nice."

"So are mine, sort of. Most of the time now, at least. Lil, that day was Mulciber's birthday, and Avery brought firewhisky into the dorm. They were all a little tipsy..."

"It isn't just that one time. They're always doing things like that. Promise me you'll try to stay a little distant from them? Please?"

Severus promised. The odd thing was that he was so preoccupied with tutoring for the upcoming OWLs and NEWTs that his dorm mates didn't even notice that he was coming in right at lights out and leaving early. Nobody questioned him, and nobody minded.&#13;
