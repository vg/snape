\subsection{Chapter 4: Chapter 4 â€“ A Friend}

\emph{In Principio...} - \textbf{A Friend}

The shock of Russ's discovery was so powerful that his reaction was physical. His heart was beating hard, not fast but hard, so that he could feel it. He had trouble breathing. He felt lightheaded and his hands began to tremble. It was all he could do to concentrate on the maths work and write something, even if it was wrong.

At lunch Russ watched Lily in the play yard. He watched stealthily, his face turned away, his eyes darting restlessly, so that no one could accuse him of watching. Lily Evans was one of the muggles he hated, hated because she had a best friend and birthday parties, because everyone talked to her and she passed notes in class. At lunch she was part of a group of four girls that always ate together and played little games that Russ didn't know the rules to.

The walk home seemed endless, and Russ was so impatient that as soon as he got to the part of the town where the gardens got lost and boards appeared over the windows, he ran.

"Hold on, young man!" Eileen exclaimed as Russ came careening through the door and burst into the kitchen. "Is there a fire?"

"Mum," Russ said breathlessly, "how many kinds of wizards are there?"

Eileen frowned. "As many different kinds as there are people. All wizards are different from all other wizards."

"No, I mean like how I'm half and half, muggle and wizard."

"Oh, that," said Eileen, and she didn't seem any happier. "Well first, there are purebloods. They have a wizard father and a witch mother. Some purebloods like to think they're one hundred percent magic, but I don't think anyone really is. Generally if all four grandparents are magic, then the grandchild is pureblood. They don't really look back further than that. Then there are part-bloods. That would be both magical parents, but maybe one of them is a half-blood. True half-bloods like you have one magical parent and one muggle parent, so magic on only one side of the family. And then there are muggle-borns."

"What are muggle-borns?" Russ tried to conceal the urgency he felt about the answer to this question.

"For some reason, occasionally a magical child is born to a nonmagical family. Everybody is a muggle, and 'bang' there's a wizard in the mix. We don't know why that happens. The opposite can happen, too. Sometimes a nonmagical child is born into a magical family. They're called squibs."

"So you could have someone you thought was a muggle, and it turns out she's a witch?" Russ asked to confirm what he hoped was true.

"Why are you asking about this?" said Eileen, turning to catch her son's eyes.

"Nothing," Russ answered, meeting her gaze calmly, all thought of the girl and the pen latched away where she couldn't see it. "I was just thinking about it this afternoon."

"Have a piece of bread and a glass of water then, and do your homework."

Russ's desk in his small upstairs bedroom was really an equipment crate turned on its side so he could stick his feet in the crate while he wrote. Now he sat at this makeshift desk while his mother baked downstairs, kicking his feet against the wood and pretending to do schoolwork. He had a lot of thinking to do.

All his life he'd known that he was the only magical child around, and that he must never talk about it or show it to anyone. This made him different, isolated and friendless, the only child in town doomed to have no friends until he was eleven and could leave. But that was more than two years away, and Russ didn't want to wait two years. He wanted a friend now. Even if she was a girl.

Russ held his feelings down, pushed them into the latched part of his brain where they couldn't bother him because he had to think carefully about this. What if he was wrong? What if there'd been no magic, just a trick of the light? After all, Lily Evans had been in the same class as him for four years, and he'd never caught a glimpse of magic before. Nor had anyone else, or they'd have talked about it. There was no reason to get excited over something that might not be true.

But he so desperately wanted it to be true. Up until that morning he'd been fine, he accepted his fate and set all his hopes on Hogwarts. Now, suddenly, the desire for a friend, for someone to share things with, welled up in him like a hunger, twisting his stomach and making him sick with longing.

He had to be sure. He couldn't afford to act on information that might not be true. Instead of doing his homework, Russ was forming a plan - a plan for watching Lily to see if she ever did any other magic. If she did, if she truly was a muggle-born witch, then Russ could find a way to talk to her, to explain to her, maybe to show her some more magic as proof - and then they could be friends.

He went to bed that night planning how the future was going to be.

Russ became a spy. He was secret agent Drake, he was John Steed and Emma Peel. He found ways to move within earshot of Lily Evans and her friends while making it look perfectly casual. He started having to kneel down and tie his shoes a lot. He began dropping pens. He started walking around with his nose ostensibly in a book, and pausing when he got to 'interesting' bits.

He found out that Lily had an older sister named Petunia who was about to take her Eleven Plus examination. He found out that Lily had a sweet temper and a gentle way about her. He found out that Lily was born in January, just like he was, except he was Capricorn and she was Aquarius.

He asked his mother about this, and she told him, along with the other signs that Russ asked about to mask his real interest, that Capricorn and Aquarius did not go well together. Capricorn was organized and Aquarius was not. Capricorn would be jealous of free-spirited Aquarius. Better be friends than look for a life together.

That suited Russ fine. He wasn't looking for a life together anyway, just a friend.

Russ discovered that Lily and Petunia lived on the eastern side of the little town, far from the area where his house was, a place of nice gardens and newer automobiles. He couldn't follow them there because he would be noticed and most likely chased away. He had to, as his mum put it in her training sessions, get his bearings and learn the lay of the land.

It was June, and the school term was nearing its close. The summer days were long. This was good news for Russ, since it meant he didn't have to be coming and going in the streets at the same time as everyone else. He could go early and wait, and then come home later. He wanted to see Lily away from school anyway. His spying was becoming frustrating. He had still not seen her perform any more magic.

The last week of school, Russ left home early every day. On Monday he waited behind a gate at the last house where he saw Lily disappear every afternoon, and from this vantage point he was able to see the direction she came from. The next morning he hid further on, and discovered more of her route. By Thursday he'd located the house. He had to wait until all the other children had gone by before he could follow them to the school building, so all that week he was late to class, but he didn't mind.

On the evening after the last day of school, Russ lay in bed planning. He had it all worked out. He would wait until he saw more magic, then he would show himself and reveal to Lily that she was a witch. She would be excited at the news and want to know more, and he would be able to teach her and tell her all about Hogwarts. Hogwarts! Maybe Lily could go there, too.

The next morning, Russ was out of the house before seven o'clock. He hid amongst some rubbish bins a ways down the street from Lily's house and waited. He would do a lot of waiting over the next few days, but the hunger inside him was ravenous now. He no longer even considered the possibility that Lily was not a witch. The bitter disappointment that would entail would, by this point, have destroyed him.

Lily and Petunia frequented a playground near their house. Sometimes there were other children there, and sometimes there were not. Russ began going to the playground instead of nearer to their house so that no one would see him in the street. There were bushes and hedges he could hide behind and under, and no one ever noticed him.

A week and a half into the break, Lily and Petunia were alone, Petunia revolving lazily on a carousel, and Lily in a swing. Lily kept going higher and higher, and Petunia stopped to watch. "You're going too high, Lily. It can be dangerous," cautioned the older sister.

"No, it's fun," Lily crowed. "It's like flying through the air. I bet if I try hard enough, I can really fly!"

"Lily!" Petunia cried. "Don't you dare!"

Lily dared. She reached the top of her arc and launched herself into space. Instead of falling, as Petunia clearly feared, she hovered for a moment, then glided lightly to the ground. "See," she said to Petunia, "I can fly."

It was Russ's moment. It was what he had been waiting for, planning for since May. He tried to get to his feet to go to the two girls, but his courage failed him. Instead, he remained, hidden and miserable behind his bushes.

Petunia started for home. "I'm going to tell Mummy you've been doing wicked things again." she called behind her. "You're going to be in so much trouble!"

Lily ran after her. "I wasn't doing anything bad. Look, I'm not hurt. There's nothing wrong with it. Tuney, come back."

Russ dragged himself home, crushed and defeated by his own timidity. His opportunity had been there, within his grasp, and he had failed to seize it. He might never have another chance.

Back at home he found that another opportunity had slipped like water through his fingers.

"You won't be going over to Mrs. Hanson's this weekend or next," his mum told him as she fixed supper. "She's taking two weeks to visit her sister in Manchester."

Russ nearly spilled his glass of water. "She can't!" he cried. "Not now! The Americans are going to the moon next week. How can I watch it if she's in Manchester?"

The following week the whole world watched the Apollo 11 moon landing except Russ. The whole world got to hear, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" except Russ. The bitterness of his disappointment was capped by the news that Mrs. Hanson would be staying in Manchester with her sister for several months, and the boarders were taking care of her house. No moon landing, no further television, no baths... The pleasures in Russ's life were narrowing to nothing.

\emph{Friday, July 25, 1969 (four days before the full moon)}

"He can't wear that jacket any more," Eileen told Toby the day after the Apollo 11 splashdown that Russ didn't see on television. He was already withdrawn and miserable about missing 'history in the making,' and at first didn't register that his mum was talking about him. "It's gotten far too short for him and there's holes in the elbows. He needs new shirts, too."

"A boy needs t' take better care of his togs, and not go wasting a man's hard-earned money," Toby complained. "You was just telling me yesterday as he needed a school uniform, too. You know we ain't got the money."

"He can't go 'round naked."

"He don't have to dress like the Marquess o' Queensbury neither. Can't help the uniform, but ain't we got togs in the house he can wear?"

Russ woke up then to the fact that they were discussing his clothes. The uniform was good news. It'd be big so he could grow into it over the next two years, but that would be better than what he was wearing now. The part about his play clothes was less important.

Mum went upstairs and started hauling things out of the makeshift storeroom. There weren't many of them - they generally used things until they were worn so bad they weren't good for anything but rags - but there were some. Some of them had belonged to Wenny. Most of them were still far too big.

"What about this?" Mum held up a strange kind of blouse or smock with a high collar and wide sleeves. The collar and sleeves had embroidery on them. Toby and Russ protested at the same time:

"No son of mine's gonna dress like a girl!"

"I can't wear that, Mum, they'd laugh at me!"

"Don't be silly," said Mum. "Wensley wouldn't have any woman's clothes. He musta picked it up in one of those countries he sailed to. Maybe China or Russia. And we ain't got anything else. It's this, or buy, or go without. What if I take the embroidery off for you, Russ? It wouldn't look so girlie then."

There were a couple of the strange smocks, one white and one blue, so Russ had one to wear and one to wash. They couldn't do anything about the pants, so he had to keep wearing his too-short jeans, but Mum did find him a jacket - sort of.

It was an old sailor's jacket, a navy-blue pea coat in worn, shabby wool. It was meant to go part way down a grown man's thigh, but on Russ it reached below his knees. The shoulders were too wide, and the sleeves far too long. Mum rolled up the cuffs to make it fit better. "I might be able to sew that," she said.

"Don't go cutting it," Toby insisted. "If he grows more, he'll need the sleeves long. That's a nice coat, that is. It'll do."

At least it was obviously a man's coat, Russ reasoned, and it would hide the funny smock.

Russ continued for the rest of July into August observing the children at the playground near Lily Evans's house. More than four weeks after his first failed attempt, Lily and Petunia were once again alone, both today on the swings. The other children had gone home.

Lily was again swinging as high as she could, and Russ held his breath, knowing she was planning to fly again.

"Lily, don't do it!" Petunia cried, but Lily just laughed and launched herself into the air, just as she had the first time, landing lightly and easily after her flight, not far from the bush where Russ was hiding.

"Mummy told you not to!" Petunia yelled at her. "Mummy said you weren't allowed, Lily!" She stopped swinging and was now trying to assert older-sister authority.

Lily was laughing at her. "But I'm fine," she said, as if that was the only problem with flying. She picked up a flower from the ground. "Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do." In her hands the dead flower began to open and close its petals like some cartoon space creature. This didn't calm Petunia in the least.

"Stop it!" she screamed.

Lily threw the flower down, and there was a hint of resentment in her voice as she said, "It's not hurting you."

"It's not right," Petunia said. Then, unable to completely hide her fascination, she added, "How do you do it?"

There it was. The moment Russ had waited for, planned for, anticipated for nearly three months. If he didn't have the courage to act now, he would never have it. He steeled himself and forced himself to rise, stepping out from behind his bush and addressing Petunia's question.

"It's obvious, isn't it?" he said, and regretted it immediately because Petunia acted as if he was some kind of wild dog and ran toward the swings. Lily didn't run, but her expression was probably the same one she wore when she took medicine. Russ could feel the color mount in his face and wished he were anywhere else. \emph{Idiot! Fool! This was never a good idea.}

After a moment Lily asked, "What's obvious?"

Russ's heart was pounding again - she wanted to talk. He didn't want Petunia to hear, so his voice, when it came out, was nearly a whisper. "I know... what you are."

"What do you mean?"

"You're... you're a witch."

"That's not a very nice thing to say to somebody!"

She huffed away, just as snooty as the rest of them. Russ hurried after her, Wenny's coat hot and heavy as it hung past his wrists in the sunny August afternoon, but Russ wasn't thinking about how he looked. "No!" he insisted, and they let him get near enough to the swings to listen to what he had to say. "You... are. You are a... witch. I've been... watching you for a... while. But there's nothing... wrong with that. My mum's... one, and I'm a... wizard."

Lily said nothing, but Petunia howled with laughter. "Wizard! I know who you are. You're that Snape boy!" and the way she said 'Snape' made it sound evil, obscene. She turned to Lily. "They live down Spinner's End by the river." Then she wheeled on Russ, who was suddenly aware how much taller she was than he. "Why have you been spying on us?"

Russ looked down, away from her accusing eyes. "Haven't been... spying. Wouldn't... spy on you anyway. You're a... muggle." That was when he realized how he must look - Wenny's pea coat loose around his shoulders and swinging past his knees, the silly foreign smock, his outgrown jeans, his hair damp and sweaty on his forehead. Like a clown.

"Lily, come on, we're leaving," Petunia announced, and it was some small revenge to note how shrill and ugly her voice sounded. The two girls stalked out, leaving Russ standing alone and defeated in the playground.

He slunk out away from the houses and onto the moor to go home along the periphery of the town. He didn't want anyone to see him. He wanted to crawl into the earth and never have anyone see him ever again.

Russ was trying to figure out what had gone wrong. Lily knew she could do unusual things. She should have been pleased to learn she was magical. She should have wanted to know more.

It was Petunia's fault. Petunia had acted as if he was dangerous, Petunia 'd made fun of his poverty and his family with her sneers and smirks. She was probably laughing about him even now with Lily. Petunia had called his honest desire for a friend 'spying,' and made it seem criminal. Now she'd probably tell all the other students at school, and they'd all laugh at him even more. Neil would have a great time with that. Instead of better, life had gotten worse, and Russ wished he was dead.

That evening he picked at his food at supper, then went straight to bed, to lie on his side facing the wall. He didn't want to see anyone or talk to anyone or go anywhere... He just wanted to lie there forever.

And the worst thing was that all he had to look forward to were two long, cold, barren, empty years. Years of enforced loneliness and silence, and he didn't think he could bear it.

"You sick?" his dad asked from the doorway.

"No, just tired. 'S hot outside. Made m' head hurt."

"That's all right then. Don't you go gettin' sick. Can't afford no doctor."

His dad left. Russ thought bitterly that there was no doctor who could help him anyway. The hunger that had nothing to do with food twisted his insides, and there wasn't any medicine for it. What he needed was someone to talk to, someone to listen, someone who'd talk to him that he could listen to...

The pain inside him was so great that Russ thought he'd burst from it, and then a strange thing happened. The painful things started to go away. Not the pain, but the things that caused the pain. One by one, the loneliness, the bitterness, the humiliation and shame all retreated from him, as if his mind suddenly said, 'I don't want you any more.' They went - he had no other way to explain it - down into the cellar of his mind and found a door Russ didn't even know was there, and they latched the door behind them.

Russ just lay in bed and let it happen, and when all the bad things were latched down, he felt curiously calm and detached from everything, like it was all just a television show, but nothing to really get upset about. He didn't feel anything - and that was a lot better than feeling pain.

The sense of calm and detachment didn't go away. The next morning Russ got up and ate breakfast - tea and toast was all - then went out exploring while his dad went to the mine and his mum went off looking for day jobs. He went out onto the moor. He had no desire to go over to the playground to watch for the two sisters. It was as if that was another person, that boy who'd been so disappointed the day before.

Instead Russ wandered for miles. The moor area wasn't large, and gave way from time to time to farms, pastures, and sparse woodland with here a tiny village and there another decaying mill town. Colne and Barrowford had many mills, mostly closed. A few other towns had mines or quarries, though Russ usually gave them a wide berth. By now he was old enough and had explored enough to have his bearings and know the lay of the land. He knew the bulk of Pendle Hill was to the west, and Yorkshire but a stone's throw to the east and north.

As he wandered Russ got to thinking that he probably ought to be of use to somebody in his life, and began to figure how he might be useful. He was too young for a real job, and the shopkeepers on the mill side couldn't afford to hire a boy. The shopkeepers on the school side would never even look at him except maybe to keep an eye out that he didn't steal anything. Odd how people expected your clothes to show how honest you were.

Around midmorning Russ found an outcrop of rock and just sat, not really thinking of anything in particular, when he noticed that as long as he kept still, there was a lot of movement around him. There were mostly birds, but some other animals as well, such as a very surprised fox that rose from the ground where it had been resting and slunk off, and a coney, its nose wiggling to pick up odors in the breeze and... a grouse.

\emph{What day is it?} was the first thing in Russ's mind, for he did know about the 'glorious twelfth,' the day the men went out to drive the grouse in the open moors, the beginning of hunting season. He thought about it all the way home.

A glass of water, a slice of bread, and Russ sat in the kitchen watching his mother as if she was a total stranger and he was a scientist observing her behavior. It was a curious feeling. He knew all about her, remembered everything he should remember, but there was no emotion attached. It made things more interesting because he found he noticed more detail, like the way she held her fingers around the handle of the knife she was chopping with, or the limp, straggling locks of hair that strayed on the collar of her dress.

When his dad came home, Russ waited patiently until he was settled, then went into the sitting room.

"Dad, d' you know how t' throw."

"Throw what, son?"

"Rocks."

Toby regarded his son carefully. "Wha' cha want t' be throwin' rocks for?"

"Huntin' season starts Tuesday. Saw a grouse out on the moor."

Toby chuckled. "'Leen! This boy thinks he can put down a grouse with a rock. Ain't that a kick?"

"Y' always did want him t' be ambitious, Toby," Mum called from the kitchen.

They started that day, in the lingering August evening, Toby showing Russ how to select stones and how to throw them, not overhand or underhand, but sharp and quick from the side. Russ found his new sense of cool apartness helped. He noticed every detail of his father's stance and movement, and copied each one with care and accuracy. Before they went in to bed, he was hitting fence posts more times than not, and Toby was beaming with pride.

Eileen took him out training on the weekend, and was impressed. "You been practicing, ain't cha?" she said. "Couldn't get past your eyes not once the whole time. Come 'ere. Let's have a look-see."

She peered into his eyes, and Russ gave her the moors and his satisfied tiredness after the hard work, and the fact that he was hungry for supper... but the other things, the fears, the failures, stayed latched away and she never even looked for them.

"Good," Eileen said at last. "You're learning right fast. We'll start with some real spells tomorrow."

On Sunday, Russ learned Expelliarmus and Protego. There was some trick to the way you held and pointed the wand for each one, so it took some concentration, but now he had three wand spells that he could actually do, because he remembered how to do Reparo. It was a shame he could only do them on the moors, and not in the town because of the muggles. Russ was always thinking of the neighbors as muggles now.

Just before school started, Russ brought down his one and only grouse. It was the first thing larger than a spider that he'd ever killed. He studied it for a while, clinically, dispassionately, then put it in the bag he now carried everywhere and took it home for his mum to cook. That was, after all, why he'd learned to throw.

\emph{Monday, September 1, 1969 (two days before the last quarter)}

By September first, Russ was willing to acknowledge that the first day of his fifth year at school was likely to be different from previous first days. It wasn't just that he was older. It wasn't just that for the first time he was wearing a new uniform that was neither clownishly big nor embarrassingly worn and small. No, it was more that there had been two important changes. The first was his expectation that Petunia Evans had spread through the entire school his claim to being a wizard, which the other students would find ridiculous and would tease him for. The second was his mastery of two fighting spells that gave him more self-confidence, combined with a continued total separation from any emotional connection to the school at all.

It wasn't until he was crossing the bridge over the river that Russ remembered something - something that altered his whole perception of the coming day, and that he could have kicked himself for not remembering earlier. Petunia Evans was no longer going to his school! She'd taken her Eleven Plus exams the previous spring and, depending on how well she'd done, was even now on her way to a grammar school or a technical school in Colne or, if she'd done poorly, to a secondary modern. She wouldn't even be at his school to tell stories about him.

That left Lily, of course, but Russ hoped she would be less interested in ridiculing him about the witch idea, and more interested in talking about it.

At first that didn't seem likely. Lily started and stared at him when she saw him in the play yard before school, but she didn't approach. On the good side, nobody teased or laughed at him. Neil tried to get at him by holding his nose and talking about 'river stench,' but Brian was gone to secondary school, too, and Neil had no backup. Russ ignored him.

The breakthrough came at lunch time.

"Is this taken?" Lily asked Russ, indicating the far end of the bench where he was sitting.

"Nah," Russ replied. "Go ahead." They ate their sandwiches in silence for several minutes. When they started talking, they allowed long pauses between sentences so that no one else would notice.

"What you said in the playground, about me, was it true?" Lily asked.

"Sure. You know most people don't do stuff like that." Russ was calm and cool. The hunger was latched down.

"Do you do 'stuff like that?'"

"Fly off swings? Nah. Don't got no swings on th' other side o' th' river. I do other things."

"What kind of things?"

"You got something broken you want fixed? I can fix it. Don't have to touch it."

"Now you're fooling me!"

"Okay, if that's what 'cha wanta believe."

There was an extended silence, then Lily said. "Can you prove it? Fix something now."

"It's not allowed in front of muggles."

"What you really mean is you can't."

Russ paused, but the latched down feelings didn't hinder his evaluation of the situation. "No. I mean I'm not allowed. If you want, I can show you. Just not here and now."

"When and where then?"

"Can you go after school t' the trees just north of the bridge? Wait for me there? Then I can show you."

"I'm not supposed to go near the river."

"Well, if you can't, you can't."

"Okay, I'll try."

"Give me a few minutes. I'll have to get m' wand."

The whole rest of the afternoon was tinged by a magic spell. If all went well, Russ was going to meet Lily by the trees just north of the bridge on the school side shortly after school. There he would show her what being a wizard meant. And yet, there was still that curious detachment, as if this was happening to another person.

Right after school, Russ ran home. He took the stairs to his bedroom two at a time and extracted his grandfather's wand from under his pillow. Tucking it carefully into his sleeve to preserve it from unworthy eyes, he ran back to the bridge and, hopefully, to Lily, the greater part of him still detached and cool.

It took a moment to see where Lily was, but she'd gotten there before he did. From the way she was crouched down by the tree, it was clear she didn't want to be seen any more than he did. Russ coughed before joining her on the grass, not wanting to startle her suddenly.

"This is my wand," he said, holding it up for her to see. "It was my grandfather's, but he's dead, so my grandmother gave it to me."

"Fix something, then." Lily was prepared to be skeptical.

Taking a small bottle from his huge pocket - a bottle he'd rescued from the rubbish and kept to practice on - Russ handed it to her and said, "Break this."

Lily examined it carefully. It looked like a normal, unbroken bottle. "How?" she asked.

"Hit it on something. Hit it on the tree."

It took several hits before Lily used enough force to break the glass. It would have been more dramatic if the bottle was shattered, but Russ was willing to take what he could get. "Now you check it and be sure you think it's really broken."

"You sound like one of those trick magicians on television."

It registered that Lily's family had a television, but Russ didn't dwell on the thought. "I just don't want you to think this isn't real," he said, and for good measure turned out his pockets and then took off the pea coat, patting the full sleeves of the smock to prove there was no second bottle hidden there. Then he brought his wand down to point at the bottle and said, \emph{"Ampullam Reparo."}

The glass sprang together and the bottle was fixed. Lily didn't want to touch it. Instead, she stared at it and examined it from a short distance as it lay on the grass. "That was pretty good," she said. "How did you do it?"

"The same way you make flowers open and close. Magic. That's why I said you were a witch. It wasn't anything bad, just a name for a girl who's magical."

"Are your parents magical, too?"

"Just my mum. My dad's a muggle - an ordinary person."

"So why are you poor? If you can do all this, why not make yourself rich?"

Russ thought about this. It was something he asked himself sometimes, even though he knew the answer. "Magic doesn't create stuff," he said. "If I make money or food, it isn't like real money or food. It doesn't last. If I have real stuff to work with, I can break it, or fix it, or make it move - once I learn how - but I can't make things that aren't there."

Lily nodded. Apparently it made sense. She looked straight at Russ. "What else can you do," she asked. "Could you fix my watch?"

Her eyes were green. Russ had never noticed that before. Green, and though round in the middle, they were pointy at the sides... A breeze inside his head was blowing the unlatched doors open, and the things that were supposed to stay down there were floating back up, and Russ was suddenly confused... He turned his head quickly away, letting the doors close again.

"I don't know," Russ answered. "I don't know the magic word for watch yet." He saw a figure move by the houses on the other side of the bridge. Panic rose - it was his mum! "Get down!" he whispered to Lily. "We shouldn't be seen together."

"Russ!" his mum was calling, and she sounded angry. "Richard Severus Snape, you come out right now!"

Russ stood up and ran for the bridge, hoping Lily kept her head down. "I'm here, Mum!" he cried out to her.

"Who're you with?" Eileen demanded. "Did you take something from the house you're not supposed to have?"

"No, Mum, I..." but she grabbed his pea coat and found the wand in the pocket.

"You did! Do you know I just got an owl from the Ministry? You used this where muggles could see! Muggles! You march home right now, young man, because this time I'm going to give you what for!"

Eileen took Russ's wrist and pulled him away from the bridge. A quick glance behind told him that Lily'd either left or was hiding. Russ knew he was in serious trouble, but with all his doors once again latched, it didn't really bother him. It was like Nana said. Sometimes you had to take a little pain to get something you really wanted. It just depended how much pain and how much you wanted it.

That afternoon, for the first time, Eileen whupped her son and whupped him good. And she was a lot better at it than Toby was.

\emph{Tuesday, September 2, 1969 (one day before the last quarter)}

The next day, Lily's behavior toward Russ remained unchanged. She sat in her seat in class and never looked at him. She stayed with her friends during play time and lunch. She giggled with the others when Russ was called on to recite and stammered his answer. And she also managed to drop a tiny scrap of paper near him that contained the one, indecipherable word 'tree.'

Russ didn't wait by the tree, he waited in the shelter of the underside of the bridge. When Lily came and sat down under the tree they'd sat under the day before, Russ came out from his hiding place and joined her.

"Were you in trouble yesterday?" Lily asked.

"Yeah. I'm not... supposed to do wand magic 'cause I'm... too young, and doing it... with a wand where muggles can see is... worse. The Ministry sent an... owl."

"An owl? The Ministry?"

"We use owls as... messengers. There's this Ministry of... Magic that has laws and... rules, and they get after you if you... break them. I broke a... rule, and 'cause I'm nine it's my... parents who get in trouble... for it. Mum was pretty... angry."

"Did she spank you?"

"She used a... hairbrush. Dad uses a... belt."

"That's terrible!"

"Not... really. There's worse they could... do."

Lily didn't reply to that. Instead she changed the subject. "She called you by a different name. Is that why you didn't know your name in our first year?"

"I didn't... think people... remembered that."

"Neil joked about it for the longest time. It was like he had something personal against you."

"My mum says we used to... play together when we were... babies. That's before the mill... closed."

"Neil's from the other side of the bridge?" Lily giggled. "Maybe that's why. He doesn't want people to know."

"Are you going to... tell?"

"Why cause trouble? So what's your real name? The one you use?"

"Severus. My parents... call me Russ."

"Severus..." Lily repeated, rolling the name in her mouth in a way that made it sound important. "What do wizards do when they grow up?"

"Don't know. When I'm... eleven I'm going to the wizard... school. It's called... Hogwarts. That's where I'll learn the important... magic. Mum says in sixth year they... start talking about careers. By then I'll... know what I'm good at."

"That'd be fun, going to a magic school."

"But you're... magic, too. That means you could... go. Heck, they probably already... know about you from the time you... did your first magic trick."

"You think so?" Lily sounded pleased at the idea of going to a magical school. "I don't think my parents would let me, though."

"Just wait 'til they... find out. They've gotta be... pleased." Russ thought about Petunia. "Don't know about your... sister, though."

"Tuney? She'll be fine. She just doesn't like me doing things Mummy and Daddy said not to. She's bossy. She likes to boss me around."

"Good job she's going to a... different school then."

"True. If she was still here - I wouldn't be here." Lily looked over at Russ. "Could you tell me all about what it's like to be a witch?"

"Sure. Right now?"

Lily looked down at her watch. "It's late," she said. "I have to go or they'll get worried and Tuney'll get suspicious. We'd better not meet every day either." She got up and brushed herself off. "See you tomorrow, Severus," she said, and was gone.

Russ went home practically floating on top of the world.

Right after finishing his homework that evening, Russ went up to his room and took his Hogwarts textbooks out from under his bed. That was also where he'd put Wenny's books on dark creatures and hexes, and he brought them out as well. There was a new importance to these things because not only did he have to be ready for Hogwarts, Lily had to be ready as well. They had only two years, and there was no time to waste.

All of his mum's books had been bought second hand. Some, like \emph{The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1)} had the name of the previous owner written on one of the front pages, and Russ wondered who people like Atticus Fringillida and Cassius Varve were. Mostly, though, he was interested in the subject matter.

For the next several days, Russ pored over \emph{A History of Magic} and \emph{Astronomical Charts for Beginners}, over \emph{Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them} and \emph{The Dark Forces: A guide to Self-Protection}. On Friday Lily slipped him a note - 'tomorrow, 2.'

Russ took this to mean two o'clock, and arrived at the bridge at one forty-five.

"I don't think this is a good place," was almost the first thing Lily said when she showed up at two-ten. "At least not on the weekend. Too many people pass by here."

Russ agreed, and suggested a place just outside the town, on the river above the old mill, where there was a sheltered thicket of trees and brush that was more shielded from passing view. They split up immediately, Russ following the west bank of the river upstream, and Lily following the east. Where the thicket was, Russ waded across because the river here was shallower.

"You didn't tell them about me, did you?" Lily asked when they were settled.

"No. My mum wouldn't want me... meeting someone she wasn't... sure about... magic, you know." Russ answered. "She doesn't... want another owl from the... Ministry."

"I can't tell my family about you either. My daddy was a supervisor at the mill. He doesn't trust the laborers on the other side of the bridge. They didn't get along."

"Who's your... father?"

"Harry Evans. I guess yours is Tobias Snape."

"Your dad... talks about my dad? Mine doesn't talk... about yours."

"No, it's just that Tuney asked if Daddy knew the families of any of the students at school. I guess she was really asking about you, but she didn't make it too obvious. She named a whole bunch of people, and Daddy told us." Lily paused, clearly embarrassed. Then she took a deep breath. "Is it true your dad's all the time in the boozer?"

"Your dad said... that?"

"Yeah. Tuney loved it. She gave me this see-I-told-you look that made me so angry. Is it true?"

Russ wanted to change the subject, but somehow asking 'Do you want to learn the history of magic' would've sounded hollow at this point. "Yeah," he said. "Him and Mum are always... arguing. On bad... days, that's when he... hits me."

"Phew, that's all right then," said Lily. "Tuney bet you'd lie about it and said if you did it'd prove I couldn't trust you. Now I can tell her how silly she is."

"D' rather you didn't... talk to her 'bout... me. She doesn't like me."

"It's all right. She's okay once you know her."

"She thinks I'm... rubbish 'cause I'm on the wrong side... of the river."

Lily's silence confirmed the truth of this statement. She changed the subject and asked about Hogwarts, and Russ began to tell her all about the courses they'd be taking - Herbology, and Transfiguration... It seemed like only a short time before Lily had to leave. They agreed to meet in the same place the following Saturday. During the week it would be as if they didn't know each other.

On arriving home, Russ thought to try Petunia's trick on his dad. He asked about the different families of his classmates.

"What 'cha wanta know that for?" his dad asked.

"Got to know who's decent and who ain't," Russ replied. "Don't wanta mix with no stuffed shirts or college puddings."

"That's m' boy," Dad said, and that was how Russ found out that 'that rat, Harry Evans' was one of his dad's least favorite people. There was no doubt now that his friendship with Lily had to be kept secret.

A secret friendship wasn't as good as a best friendship, but it was so many steps higher than anything Russ 'd had before that he wasn't going to quibble. He didn't see Lily every Saturday (though he was at the tree every Saturday), but the chances he had to talk to her quickly became the most important thing in his life.

\emph{Saturday, November 15, 1969 (the day before the first quarter)}

Russ paced impatiently by their tree. He was fairly sure two o'clock had come and gone, but he didn't want to pass up this particular meeting and was willing to wait until dark if necessary. He glanced at the sun in the southwest. Two-thirty maybe? Two-forty-five? The he saw her, and sat down so that no chance observer would see two young figures by the river.

"Hi," Lily said as she sat down next to him. She was bundled up more warmly than he, with scarf and hat as well as her winter coat.

"Did you see it?" Russ asked, ignoring the formalities.

"No, but it was on the news. It got hit by lightning."

"What! They're not... It didn't..." he couldn't even say the words.

"No, they're all right. Just after takeoff a bolt of lightning hit, and I think it damaged something because they were taking about how the information was garbled or something, but everything else seems to be okay."

Russ sighed deeply. He knew Lily wasn't as interested in this as he was, and it was kind of her to relay reports. Certainly better than the Apollo 11 landing when he had to scrounge newspapers for any kind of information. He was still going to scrounge newspapers, but there was more a sense of immediacy with Lily watching her television.

"What about the lunar landing?" he asked. "That's... Wednesday morning about seven. Are you going to be able to... watch that?"

"I'll try," Lily promised, and the conversation switched to school and Lily's most recent tiff with Petunia. Russ wished he had a brother or sister to have a tiff with. It seemed to make life more interesting.

Wednesday morning, Russ was at school early. Lily gave him a surreptitious thumb's up when she came in, then left a note wedged between her books for him to retrieve on the way to recess. The note said, 'TV not working. Nobody can see it.'

It was a grim sort of satisfaction to learn that the well-off with their televisions were in exactly the same position as he was without. His poverty - he knew the word now and accepted the reality it represented - was not a disadvantage at this moment. Nobody was watching the Apollo 12 moon walk.

There was one more important moment, maybe the most important of all, and Russ and Lily had to arrange that the following Saturday.

"It'll be about nine o'clock at night. Will you be able to... watch?"

"I think so. I don't know if they'll show it, though. I can have a radio on, too. They'd announce something. How do I let you know?"

Russ had that already planned. "I'll sneak out and go around and be... waiting out in the dark. Do you have a flashlight?"

"You mean shine it out the window? Like a signal?"

"Yeah. One flash if something went... wrong, two if they're okay."

"Okay. Are you going to have trouble getting out?"

"I don't think so. I've been practicing."

Monday evening, Russ said goodnight to his parents and started up to his room at eight o'clock.

"You got more homework tonight?" his dad asked. "That school ain't turnin' you into no pudding, is it?"

"Nah, Dad. Just showing 'em I ain't no dummy. I'm going to bed right when I finish, though. See ya in the morning."

From there it was easy to arrange his bed to look like he was in it, then to sneak into the small store room at the back and out the narrow window. He had a length of rope there that he could tie and lower to help him down and back up. No one would notice it hanging there in the dark.

Russ also had a flashlight, since he couldn't be sure how long it would take him to get to where he could see Lily's house and the window to her bedroom. If she didn't see his answering gleam of light, she was supposed to repeat the message in fifteen minutes. By the stars, it was around nine o'clock when he took up his position on the cold moors.

He didn't have long to wait. About ten minutes later, there was a flash of light, followed by a second flash. He let his own light shine for a few seconds, then carefully picked his way back home across the moors and let himself in through the window. His parents were none the wiser.

As he got into bed, Russ considered that life was pretty good. Apollo 12 was back with a safe splashdown, and he had a friend who could tell him about it. Life didn't get much better than that.
