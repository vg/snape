\subsection{Chapter 6: Chapter 6 â€“ A New World}

\textbf{A Difference in the Family: The First Year: A New World}

\emph{Wednesday, September 1, 1971 (four days before the full moon)}

"Russ, wake up. Wake up, child. Shh!"

Russ roused himself on the hard wood of the church pew where he'd spent the night, his mother's urgency vibrating in him. "What's happening, Mum?" he whispered.

"Sexton. It must be around six o'clock. Quick. He mustn't see us."

The two slipped off the pew as the lights came on and, making use of the columns and aisles, managed to stay out of sight of the sexton of St. Pancras Church. It was, in fact, six thirty-six on the morning of September 1, 1971, and neither mother nor son was supposed to be in the church at all.

"This way," Eileen hissed, and Russ followed her into a lavatory near the parish hall. There, not turning on any lights for fear of discovery, they made quick ablutions. Then they snuck back into the nave of the church to wait until, as people straggled in for morning prayer, they could slip out into the crisp morning air of London.

Eileen and Russ sat on the steps of the church portico. "You have to show me now," the mother said. "How do we get to the train station?"

Russ stood to get his bearings. At eleven and a half, he was still so thin-boned and small that few would guess him older than seven. His most prominent features were long, lank black hair, stunningly dark eyes, and a nose already predominating in his small, sharp face. No director, casting for a stage or film production of Dickens's \emph{Oliver Twist} could have passed him up for the part of the Artful Dodger. He had that air of being too old in a body that was too young.

"Euston Road to the right," Russ said. "Then right again and the subway under the car park." He pointed to the northeast. "That way," he said.

"Good boy. Mum's proud of you. They won't lose you, not in the biggest city in the world. Not anywhere."

Together the two turned right and walked to Euston Road, then right again to the underground passageway that took them across the busy street to the area in front of King's Cross Station. Eileen fumbled in her sweater and shawl, and pulled out a little cardboard ticket.

"Give us a moment, Russ," she said. "I got something I have to do."

By this time it was after eight o'clock, and the ticket booths were all open. Eileen left her son by a news vendor and went to a window to argue with a clerk, coming back a few minutes later with a fist full of coins.

"What'd you do, Mum?" Russ asked, eyeing his mother's hand. "Dad didn't give you any money."

"Now you got no reason to tell your Dad about this. He's going to meet me at the station in Colne and no questions. I just won't start from London." She let Russ see the tip of a wooden stick, about ten inches long that protruded from her sleeve.

"You brought the wand? I won't peach. Where're you jumping to?"

"I'll pick up the train in Wolverhampton, and no one the wiser. It'll give us more time together. But now, Master Snape, I'm going to treat you to breakfast. Real English breakfast in a real station restaurant. You never had kippered herring before, did you?"

They got a little table in the station breakfast room, and with the money she got from trading in her train ticket, Eileen treated Russ to bacon, eggs, toast, kippers, and even a cup of coffee. He ate with a healthy appetite, a good sign since he so often suffered from a nervous stomach.

As they ate, mother and son practiced a strange sort of catechism.

"In your classes..."

"I don't know anything. Everything they show me is new."

"They teach you a new spell..."

"I do it wrong the first time, so they don't suspect."

"With the boys in your dormitory..."

"I take the last place, I don't make trouble, I don't make enemies."

"And you never, ever, ever..."

"Let them steal my thoughts."

"Russ, I am going to miss you. Nana'll send you an owl every month. Anything happens, and you tell her."

"Yes, Mum."

After breakfast they wandered through the station, watching the people and reading the covers of the magazines in the kiosks. Eileen bought Russ a snack to eat on the train - "Healthier than the stuff they sell off the sweets trolley, and you don't need sickles to buy it." A little after ten o'clock, she murmured, "There's the first of them."

Russ looked in the direction she nodded. Two families were crossing the station heading for the platforms. They wore peculiar combinations of clothing and colors that made them look like mummers or circus performers. His mother had told him how hard it was for most wizards to blend in with normal people, but he hadn't really seen it before this day.

"We'd better get your things." Eileen took another ticket from her sweater pocket and went with a trolley to `Left Luggage.' There she picked up the old Gladstone bag and the small footlocker. It had taken a while to convince Toby to give her the money to leave the things, but she'd talked about how hard it would be to run with them if they were caught, and he'd given in.

"This way, Russ, to platform nine." The platform was a perfectly normal train platform, but the show was delightful. Any number of oddly dressed people with luggage trolleys approached the decorative bricked arch between platforms nine and ten, looked around stealthily as if planning a robbery, then scooted through the brick wall. Both Eileen and Russ had a lovely half hour watching them, though Russ was also keeping an eye open for Lily and her family.

"All right," Eileen said finally, "your turn." Sedately the perfectly normal looking pair, she in working class dress, sweater, and shawl, Russ in trousers, shirt, and a sweater, walked to and through the place in the arch. No one noticed them.

On the other side it was another world, almost like stepping a hundred and twenty-five years into the past. A bright red steam locomotive puffed beside the platform, and people in colorful capes and cloaks, no longer out of place, lingered to say last goodbyes to the children they were sending off to school.

Further along, Russ finally spotted Lily. She must have arrived while his mum was getting the luggage. All four of them stood about halfway down the platform, Mr. and Mrs. Evans clearly enjoying watching all the color and display of the wizarding world. Lily and Petunia seemed to be arguing quietly a few yards away. Russ couldn't make any signal to Lily since no one but Petunia was even aware they knew each other. Suddenly shy, Russ huddled by his mother. This was an unknown world his mother was sending him into, and she was sending him alone for the first time in his life. Even Lily's presence couldn't prevent the disturbing sense of insecurity.

"Don't turn scaredy-cat on me now, Russ," Eileen said. "This is my world, the world your dad can't enter. You got to get used to it, too." The platform was emptying as eleven o'clock ticked closer. "Think what your dad would say if you turned tail now. Just remember, as the train gets near Hogsmeade you have to put on the robes. And let the station people take care of your things. Now, get on up."

Russ lugged the bag to the train, almost the last of the students to board. He turned to wave to his mum, but the station attendants had already closed the door. He could see her through the window, but he wasn't sure she could see him. The train lurched, then began to chug from the station. Russ picked up his bag again and made his way along the corridor toward the rear of the train, looking for the second-class cars.

There were no second-class cars. It took a while for Russ to realize this as he passed through car after car of first-class compartments. And every compartment was occupied. There was no place that he could enter without intruding on groups of friends and schoolmates, laughing and talking together, most of them older and all of them bigger than he was.

It took him over half an hour to traverse the entire train. At last he came to the end of the last passenger car and found himself face to face with the baggage compartment. Nowhere in all that long train had there been a place to sit by himself. Nowhere a place where he didn't have to slide open a door and meet the hostile stares of total strangers, eyes all fixed on him.

At that point, two things occurred to Russ. The first was that here, alone by the baggage car, he had a chance to change into his Hogwarts robes in private, and he did so. The second was that Lily must be in one of those first class compartments he'd passed, and he might, if he went back looking through all the compartment windows, find her and be able to sit with her. More slowly now, he retraced his steps, stopping to check every face in the compartments he passed.

Lily was sitting by the far window near the middle of the train, the seat opposite her empty. She was staring at the passing landscape, and Russ had the odd feeling that she'd been crying. Paying no attention to the others in the compartment, Russ opened the door and crossed over, sitting facing her.

Lily barely glanced at him. "I don't want to talk to you."

"Why not?"

"Tuney h...ates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore." It sounded like Lily was going to start crying again.

"So what?" Russ said. He was thoroughly confused. Lily had shown him the house, Lily had opened the letter, Lily had handed it to him. He could see that Lily might be upset with Petunia, or even with herself, but not why she was angry with him.

The comment got Russ a glare, however. Lily clearly blamed him for something, so he must have done something. "So she's my sister!" Lily snapped.

"She's only a..." Russ stopped. There was a mystery here that he didn't understand. It had something to do with being brothers and sisters. Neil and Brian Philips were always fighting, yet Brian bullied people Neil didn't like. Russ didn't know Petunia very well, but every time he'd seen her, she was bossing Lily around or arguing with her. Lily was nevertheless always on Petunia's side. In any case, where they were going, he'd never have to worry about muggles again. A sudden loud laugh from one of the boys sharing the compartment reminded him, too, that he shouldn't go around mentioning that Lily was muggle-born. Not until he got his bearings and knew the lay of the land.

Deciding Lily just needed cheering up, Russ said happily, "But we're going! This is it! We're off to Hogwarts!" Lily wiped her eyes and gave him a little smile. His stab at taking her mind off Petunia was working. Now Russ was concentrating on the future, on a time approaching with the speed of the train they were riding, a time when he'd always have someone to talk to without having to hide his friendship from everyone. He returned Lily's smile. "You'd better be in Slytherin," he told her, knowing that to be his destiny as well.

Their conversation was interrupted by a sneering voice. "Slytherin?" said one of the boys, curling his lip and looking arrogantly down his nose at Russ. He turned to his companion. "Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?"

The other boy appeared equally arrogant, stretched out across two seats as if he owned the whole compartment by right of birth. His demeanor was identical to that of Brian Philips. "My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said.

Russ tried to ignore them, but he was suddenly seized with a sense of horror that he might have to live in the same place as this boy, and for the first time he thought about the implications of everything his mother had told him of dormitories.

The two boys ignored him as well. "Blimey, and I thought you seemed all right!" the first boy said.

"Maybe I'll break the tradition," the other replied with a big smile. "Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?"

The first boy posed, like a man with a sword. "'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad." Russ sniffed, and the boy rounded on him. "Got a problem with that?"

There was menace in the boy's attitude, and Russ began to shut down. "No," he replied. "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy..."

The slouching boy joined in. "Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither," he said, provoking the other boy to laughter.

Lily stood up, her face set and angry. "Come on, Severus," she said with forced calm, "let's find another compartment."

Both boys mocked Lily, and the Gryffindor boy stuck out his foot to trip Russ as he passed. "See ya, Snivellus!" the sloucher called as Lily slammed the compartment door shut.

"What unpleasant people!" Lily exclaimed as the two of them moved through the train. "I thought you said Hogwarts would be a nice place."

"All except... Gryffindor," Russ said. "My mum told me that... Gryffindor students always looked... down on Hufflepuffs."

Lily paused and looked at Russ carefully. "They really bothered you, didn't they? You're stammering again." She waited, but Russ didn't reply. "Okay, Severus, what's a Hufflepuff?" she continued.

"There're four... houses. Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and... Gryffindor. They put this hat on your... head, and it tells everyone which... house you go into. That's where you live."

"So why are you going to Slytherin if your mum went to Hufflepuff?"

"My grandmother did this star chart for me, and it... said I'd go to Slytherin."

"Well," Lily said, "at least it's better than Gryffindor."

"Do you want to find another compartment?" Russ felt that if Lily was with him, he wouldn't be as shy about entering one of them.

"No. Is there any place else we can sit?"

Russ led Lily back to the space between the last passenger compartment and the baggage car, where they settled themselves onto the floor of the train. Leaning back against a panel, feet drawn up and arms around their knees, they managed to relax in the quiet and complete privacy of the little out-of-the-way nook. There they chatted, ate their food, and watched the passing scenery - and generally enjoyed the rest of the trip to Hogwarts.

It was getting dark when Russ and Lily were startled by a voice over a loudspeaker telling the students that they'd be arriving in five minutes and to leave their luggage on the train. Quickly Lily ran back to the compartment to get her robes and returned a few minutes later looking upset, though she refused to tell Russ what happened when she reencountered the two unpleasant boys. Russ stood guard with his back to Lily while she changed into robes. The train was slowing down.

Students were in the corridor, straining for a glimpse of the school, a glimpse that was denied them as the train braked to a crawl and then stopped in a tiny rural station with only one platform. Most of them seemed to know where they were going, and Russ and Lily let them go first, hanging back unobserved so that they could observe the others. They left their bags in a compartment that was now empty except for the luggage.

When they stepped from the train, students milled around them, a wall of black that they couldn't see around or through, but to their right a booming voice was calling, "First years! This way, first years! Get together over here 'n follow me!"

Russ and Lily glanced at each other, then followed the voice, and soon most of the students were behind them as they tagged after the other first years and the great voice.

It was dark, the sun having set and the moon not yet risen. The line of students had entered a forest, for Russ could both hear and smell the pine trees, and noted the occasional skitter of some tiny creature disturbed by the passage of a horde of children. The path began to slant downward, and the footing was uncertain, forcing Russ to concentrate to keep up with the others and at the same time keep from falling. One good thing was that being in the rear and now slightly above the others, he could see that the one leading them had a lantern, and the small light bobbing far down the hill helped him get his bearings. He walked in front of Lily, and she held his hand to steady herself on the path.

Then there was a turn and the path opened onto the beach around a large lake, but Russ didn't notice the lake much. Still a ways up the hill, he could see over the heads of those in front, and what he saw made him stop, mouth open in wonder.

It was a great castle set high on a cliff on the other side of the lake, and every window blazed with light in the darkness around it. Russ had never seen anything so beautiful in all his short life. Beside him, Lily whispered, "Oh, how marvelous. You were right; this is wonderful."

He would have stayed there watching that castle all night long, but the voice was once again booming, "Into the boats now, four t' a boat. Everybody into a boat. We don't want t' be late."

Russ then saw the owner of the voice, a giant of a man with a great beard and massive frame. Russ didn't come to much past his knee. Beyond the monstrous figure were the boats, all of them occupied as the train compartments had been occupied. Russ's eyes flickered from the huge man to the forbidding boats, to the last students clambering into them, and didn't know what to do.

The monster knew what to do. "Come on, lass. Come on lad. Don't be shy. Here's a spot for ya." He guided Lily to a boat with three girls already in it, then swept Russ up in a great arm and placed him surprisingly gently into the last empty place in the last boat. The other students never noticed; his companions didn't even turn to look at him. They were all staring at the castle, and Russ was relieved that things so far were going relatively well.

The boats glided across the water, propelled by magic, into a cave under the castle's cliff. Inside was a grotto where the boats docked to allow the students to disembark. Once again Russ and Lily brought up the rear, climbing in the dark up a narrow rock passage to the top of the cliff. At the entrance to the castle, they were met by a tall, dark-haired witch who peered at them over wire glasses.

"The first years, Professor McGonagall," the monster said, and the group of students entered Hogwarts Castle.

They were ushered into a sort of antechamber where Professor McGonagall explained to them about the houses they were to be sorted into. Russ paid polite attention, but there was nothing new in what she said. It was basically exactly what he'd told Lily on the train.

Then it was time, and the first years filed out of the antechamber into the Great Hall, open to the night sky and aflame with torches, pulsing with the laughter and chatter of nearly two hundred fifty students, laughter and chatter that was stilled as the first years entered. Russ wasn't tall enough to see much, but he could feel the stares, and it unnerved him to be in the center of the circle of eyes.

In front of the teacher's table, the first years were arranged with the short ones in front and the tall ones in back so, though he wasn't happy being in front, Russ was finally able to see. There on the dais was Professor McGonagall holding a battered old wizard's hat. Beside her was a stool. "When I announce your name, come forward and sit on the stool," she said, and then called, "Adams, Clarissa."

The role call went slowly, for sometimes the hat had to think before pronouncing `Gryffindor!' or `Ravenclaw!', but it gave Russ time to observe the other students. He particularly listened for the boys being sorted into Slytherin house, for they would most likely be his dormitory mates.

The nasty, slouching boy from the train responded to the name `Black, Sirius,' and Russ held his breath. The Hat cried out "Gryffindor!" and Russ was able to breathe again.

'Edison, Mitchell' was the first Slytherin boy sorted, then it was the turn of `Evans, Lily,' and Russ again held his breath. To his horror and intense disappointment, the Hat didn't hesitate at all before calling "Gryffindor!" Russ moaned slightly, and kept his eyes on Lily as she joined the Gryffindor table. She looked back at him with a wan smile then, forced to sit close to `Black, Sirius', she firmly turned her back on him.

Now, suddenly, Russ felt that he could even put up with `Black, Sirius' if he could just be sorted into Gryffindor house. But of course, that was not in the stars. The names of the Gryffindor boys became as important to him as the names of the Slytherin boys. One Gryffindor girl had also been sorted before Lily, but Russ didn't remember her name. He'd have to find out, though, because she was one of Lily's dormitory mates. Then came: `Jones, Calpurnia' - Gryffindor; `Lupin, Remus' - Gryffindor; `Macdonald, Mary' - Gryffindor; `Mulciber, Aloysius' - Slytherin; `Pettigrew, Peter' - Gryffindor; the sneering one from the train, `Potter, James' - Gryffindor; `Rosier, Evan' - Slytherin...

And then - "Snape, Severus."

Russ stepped forward, climbing awkwardly onto the sorting stool, and felt the Hat slide onto his head.

\emph{Danger!} Tentacles were thrusting into his mind - horrid, probing things sucking at the thoughts he kept locked away! Instantly Russ shut down, the doors in his brain slamming and bolting, shielding his thoughts from the probe. Adrenaline poured into his system to battle the threat, and Russ instinctively groped for the wand he usually kept in his sleeve, the wand that at this moment was still in his Gladstone bag. But the probing tentacles had already stopped, baffled by the barriers.

The Sorting Hat spoke. "Is there no student here? I cannot sort someone who does not exist. Where is the student?" It paused. "Yes, here he is. Here is the wall he builds against me. But where is the student behind the wall? Does he hold his secrets so close? A boy who hides his true self so completely can only be... SLYTHERIN!"

Utterly mortified, Russ slipped off the stool. Not only was he not with Lily, the Hat had told everyone there was no student there to sort. Then he noticed that the Slytherin table was clapping politely and that the expressions of the students around him hadn't changed. \emph{They didn't hear}, he thought. \emph{The hat spoke to me, but not to them.} It was small, but it was a comfort.

Quietly Russ made his way to the section of the Slytherin table where the first years sat, close to the teachers. There he joined the three boys who'd already been sorted. A tall, blond, older student wearing a badge came over to congratulate him. A few minutes later, `Wilkes, Aaron' was sorted into Slytherin, too, and they were five. `Vance, Sally' and `Wintergreen, Paladin' were in Gryffindor.

Aaron Wilkes sat next to Severus, and the other three Slytherin boys sat opposite. "What's your name again?" a big boy with dark hair asked him.

"Severus," Russ replied, barely looking up. "Severus... Snape."

"I'm Aloysius Mulciber. You play Quidditch?"

Russ shook his head. His mother had mentioned Quidditch to him, but he'd never been on a broom. "I'm not... good at things like... that," was all he said.

"I play Quidditch at home," said Aaron. "I'm Aaron Wilkes. That's my cousin Evan Rosier, and you are...?" He was speaking to a tall, sturdy blond boy.

"Mitchell Edison. I play Quidditch, too. I'm a pretty good chaser."

"Great!" Aloysius said. "I'm better as a beater. If either of you is a good seeker or a keeper, we've got the start of a team!"

At that point announcements were made by the Headmaster about what was not permitted, and the welcoming feast began. Suddenly the table was loaded with all kinds of things to eat, many of which Russ had never seen before. His four classmates dug in with fervor. Russ examined the fare carefully. He was nervous, and therefore not hungry. He took a piece of chicken and a chunk of bread. Around him, as if on cue, silvery ghosts began to flit.

This wasn't at all daunting, since Eileen had told Russ all about the ghosts. There were around twenty of them, and four were the patrons of the four houses. Slytherin's ghost was the Bloody Baron, a stern, taciturn spirit adorned with gouts of spectral blood. After introducing themselves, the phantoms were considerate and allowed the students to eat undisturbed.

Russ had been placed so his back was to the rest of the hall and the Gryffindor table on the far side of the room. He wanted to glance back and see how Lily was dealing with the ghosts, but he didn't dare.

Aloysius, Mitchell, Aaron, and Evan talked of nothing but Quidditch for the entire feast. They discussed the national teams, described games they watched, and bragged of their own abilities. Russ couldn't even follow the conversation since he didn't know how the game was played. At that moment, he didn't care. He wished the feast were over so that they could go to bed. Maybe on the way out he could speak to Lily.

Dessert came, and Russ tried a pastry, but it was so much sweeter than anything he was used to that he knew if he ate it he'd be sick. It seemed like an eternity before the prefects were told to escort the first years to their houses.

The seventy students of Slytherin house left the Great Hall first. Russ was finally able to look over at Lily, and she raised a hand and gave a tiny wave. He did the same and then with the others trooped across the entrance hall to the stairs leading to the dungeon level. In fact, they went down several levels until Russ thought they must be around the same depth as the boat grotto. They stopped in front of a blank wall.

\emph{"Dens Serpentis,"} one of the prefects said, and the wall slid open to reveal another flight of stairs leading down into a large common room with green lamps and sea-green walls. Russ didn't ask, but he had the feeling they were under the lake. The new students were shown the lavatories and then taken to their dormitories, which split off a long corridor, boys on the right and girls on the left.

A few minutes later, they were called back into the common room. The tall, blond prefect who'd greeted Russ after his sorting rose to address all the Slytherin students.

"This is going to be brief because we're all tired and want to go to bed," he said with a smooth voice that held the hint of a drawl. "You all know me. For the benefit of the first years, my name is Lucius Malfoy, and I'm the senior male prefect of the house. Sarah Urquhart is the senior female prefect. Sixth year prefects are Brutus Gamp and Victoria Vaisey, and fifth year are Rabastan Lestrange and Beatrice Bole. Prefects are in charge of discipline in the house, and you obey a prefect the way you obey a teacher."

Malfoy glanced around at the students. "You first years should know that we have a new headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He used to teach Transfiguration, and he was the deputy headmaster, but he's been the one really in charge for years, ever since the last headmaster, Dippet, started getting too old to do the job. Dumbledore favors Gryffindor, always has. He was subtle about it while Dippet was still nominally in charge, but now he's showing his true colors.

"The most powerful students in the school are the head boy and girl. They're in charge of schoolwide discipline and supervise all the prefects. They also represent the students to the faculty when there are problems. Normally the job is divided between a boy and a girl of different houses. Dumbledore has appointed a Gryffindor both as head boy and as head girl, shutting out all three of the other houses. The new Head Boy is Fabian Prewett, and the new Head Girl is Cindy McLaggen."

A murmur of discontent swept through the Slytherin students at this news. It appeared that neither of the two was popular.

Malfoy held up a hand for quiet. "I want to caution you all. They'll be looking for ways to deduct points from Slytherin house and to put Slytherin students on detention. And from what we saw of Dumbledore last year, he'll back them all the way. Everybody has to be on his guard. We can't give them excuses for striking at us. That's all. You all need to get to sleep." With that the students left the common room, most of them talking excitedly. The first years were quieter, not understanding exactly what the speech had been about.

Back in the dormitory, the five new boys found their things laid out on chairs next to their beds. Each bed also had a night stand by the head and a storage chest at the foot. Russ's bed was near the door. Aaron went to his bed on the far side of the room from the door and looked it over. Then he went to Russ.

"I prefer the bed near the door. What say we switch?"

\emph{Don't make trouble. Don't make enemies.} "All right," Russ said. "Which one do... I take?"

"The one on the far side of the room. Opposite the fireplace."

Russ moved his things. It wasn't hard to do as he had so few of them. Then he sat on the bed and examined his new school uniform. It was a straight, black, belted medieval gown with green and silver embroidery on collar and cuffs, the Slytherin colors. The cap was a green and silver biretta. Russ took off his black academic robe and laid it over the chair, too, then did the same with the cloak from his bag. His mum hadn't needed to alter it for him, and it still bore the black and yellow badger shield from her own school days.

"What's that? Hufflepuff?" Evan snorted.

"My mother was... in Hufflepuff." He'd have to remove the Hufflepuff badge.

"That explains it," Mitchell said. "I didn't think I'd heard of anyone named Snape in Slytherin. But you're Slytherin now."

"Yes," said Russ quietly. He noticed that the bed had curtains, and he pulled them so that he could undress in privacy, which caused some amusement among the other boys. Then all five of them went to bed.

Russ had never before slept in a room with other people or in a room with no windows, where you couldn't look out and see the moon and the stars. When the lights were out, it was pitch black. In addition, Aloysius snored. It was a while before Russ was able to fall asleep. Instead, he stared blindly up into the darkness at the invisible canopy of his bed, wondering what Lily was doing. He had so little in common with his four dorm mates that he couldn't imagine being friends with them. It was a good thing he already had a friend. That way he wouldn't have to worry about what the others thought of him. All he had to do was stay out of trouble.

\subsection{Thursday, September 2, 1971}

Russ woke early the next morning, his whole life with his father making him sensitive to any change in the night. Aware at once of his surroundings, he was surprised to note that the room had grown perceptibly less dark. Even without windows, it seemed that the light of dawn was allowed to filter into Slytherin house through the water of the lake. The light had a soft greenish tint to it.

Glancing over at his clothes, Russ saw that they'd changed. He sat up, feet dangling off the side of the bed away from the others, and examined his robes. They were the same, except bands of embroidered green and silver had been added to his academic robe, down the front and banding the wide sleeves, and the Hufflepuff badge had been replaced by the Slytherin snake. Russ had no idea how this had happened except by a magic spell. He was worried that performing magic in the room hadn't wakened him. It meant he wasn't safe.

There was an envelope on the night stand. Opening it, Russ found the Hufflepuff badge. It made him feel better to think he still had his mother's insignia, and he slipped the envelope with its contents into the drawer of the stand. Then he stood up.

Everyone else was sleeping soundly. It was the perfect time to be up and about. Gathering his new robes, Russ padded barefoot out of the dormitory to the lavatory where, completely by himself, he washed and got dressed. There was a mirror there, but he didn't look at it until after he was done.

There in the mirror was a tiny, slender wizard, the green and silver biretta holding his long black hair neatly in place around his small, pale features, the black belted gown and flowing robe giving him an almost priest-like appearance. For the first time in his life, Russ was pleased with the way he looked. The robes suited him.

He went back to his dormitory and took some care putting his things into the storage chest. There wasn't much. Just the clothes he'd worn the day before, another pair of trousers and another shirt, some underwear, toothbrush and comb, his books, and the cloak.

Then he sat on the bed with his History of Magic book and waited for the others to wake up.

That didn't happen until the wake-up bells rang at six-thirty. Russ's four roommates staggered out of bed and to the boys' lavatory, then returned and transformed the whole business of dressing into a pillow fight initiated by Aaron and Evan. After that they trooped off, Russ with them, to the Great Hall for breakfast. On the way out, they were informed that the password had been changed to \emph{Toujours pur} by Sarah Urquhart.

Once in the Great Hall, Russ stayed with the other first year boys at the Slytherin table since he wasn't sure whether anything else he did might be a mistake. The talk was about broomsticks, a subject Russ knew nothing about, and so he was quiet, munching on a piece of toast and drinking water. The others poured themselves a drink that looked a bit like orange juice, but when Russ tried it, it tasted strange, so he didn't take any more.

While he half listened to the chatter of the other boys, Russ looked around the Hall. It was very different from the night before in that the students didn't seem to feel as if they had to sit in a particular place. Some came in groups, others individually, a couple were reading books, and clearly many of them were still in their dormitories getting dressed and ready for the day.

Lily was at the Gryffindor table, and Russ raised his hand just below shoulder height when he caught her eye. She waggled her hand in return, then went back to eating breakfast with the little group of girls that were her dorm mates. Russ was happy that she seemed so happy, but wished he was with her instead of where he was.

A little later a short, fat professor with thinning hair came by, greeting many of the Slytherin students by name and handing out schedules. The older students had just their regular classes for the semester, while the first years had orientation in the morning and started their first classes in the afternoon.

Back in Slytherin house, Russ went to his storage chest for his toothbrush, at which point he found Aaron right behind him.

"So, Hufflepuff, what house was your father in?"

Russ didn't look at him, not wanting eye contact. Instead he carefully closed and latched the chest. "He didn't... go to Hogwarts," was all he said.

"You talk funny. Where're you from?"

"Lancashire."

"Northern boy. So where did your father go to school?"

"Just an... ordinary school."

The momentary silence was full of danger. Then Aaron sneered, "You mean a muggle school? Hey, Evan, I think we've got ourselves a half-breed in Slytherin house."

Russ bristled. "I'm a... half-blood, not a dog."

"Half-bloods are dogs. What's that word, Evan?"

"Mongrel."

"Yeah, one of those."

"Come on," said Mitchell from the other side of the room, "lay off, why don't you. He didn't do anything to you."

Aaron whipped around. "Are you a half-breed, too? Or just a muggle-lover?" he turned back to Russ, "Like his mom."

A prefect stuck his head in the doorway. "Into the common room, first years. Head of house is here."

The argument dropped as the five boys filed from the room, Aaron pushing his way first. Russ, of course, was the last one out and stayed to the rear of the assembled house where he couldn't see and had trouble hearing.

The fat professor with thinning hair was Professor Slughorn, potions teacher and head of Slytherin house. He gave what was clearly the same speech he gave every year about doing their best and making Slytherin proud. Then he sent all but the first years off to their classes.

"Let's see, who do we have this year?" Slughorn muttered as he sorted through his papers. "Ah, yes. Wilhelmina Alderton?"

"Here, sir," said a plump blonde.

"Such a sweet girl. Your father works for the \emph{Daily Prophet}, doesn't he? Mitchell Edison?"

"Here, sir," said Mitchell.

"Your uncle was one of my students many years ago. He's the Seeker for the Chudley Cannons now, I believe. Your mother was a lovely girl, truly beautiful. I remember her well. Doris Gamp? So nice to see the old families continuing in Slytherin. Claudia Higgs? Your mother went in the Department of Law Enforcement, no? Sonya MacFusty? Are you one of the Hebridean MacFustys? Excellent family. Aloysius Mulciber? I seem to recall your grandfather made a fortune in South American mines. Evan Rosier? I hear your father is making quite a stir in the world these days. Severus Snape? Yes. Maladicta Trimble? Isn't your uncle the one who wrote our Dark Arts text? I thought I recognized the name. And Aaron Wilkes, another family expanding its influence, you must be proud. Now students, if you will follow those two prefects, they'll give you a tour of the school. I'll be talking to each of you personally this evening after dinner."

With that, Professor Slughorn left.

The fifth year prefects started out by showing the first years how not to get lost in the dungeons. It was like a three-dimensional labyrinth. The most sensible thing to do was learn the way in and the way out and never deviate from it. Russ was beginning to find the sheer size of Hogwarts frightening.

Back in the upper levels of the dungeons, the prefects showed them the Potions room and the door to Slughorn's office. Then they went into the entrance hall. "You know where the Great Hall is. Down that way are a bunch of classrooms we seldom use except as study areas. On the other side of the staircase is the passage to the kitchens and Hufflepuff house (Aaron nudged Evan at this information), and down that way are lavatories and more staircases to the upper floors."

It turned out that Hogwarts had seven floors above the ground area and a large number of towers. Each floor was laid out differently, and the corridors didn't seem to intersect at right angles. Some of the staircases went in different directions on odd days of the week. By the time orientation was over, Russ was sure of only two things: the nurse was on the first floor, and the library was on the fourth. Beyond that, he was more lost than when he'd started.

By this time the morning classes had ended, and the school was going to lunch. Russ stood in the back of the Great Hall and observed the freewheeling way students came and went, just as they did at breakfast. Lily wasn't there. \emph{It would be easier}, he thought, \emph{if I just took a sandwich and ate in the dormitory. That way I wouldn't have to sit with the others.}

There were a variety of sandwiches, and Russ took one that looked like chicken. He went down the dungeon steps and puzzled his way slowly through the twists, turns, and staircases that led to Slytherin house. On the second try he pronounced \emph{Toujours pur} correctly and entered, going straight to the dormitory.

Aaron and Evan had his chest open and were looking through his things.

"That's... mine," said Russ from the doorway.

"Hufflepuffs have to pay a fine if they want to stay in Slytherin," said Aaron, and Russ realized they were looking for money.

"It's mine," Russ repeated.

"Leave it, Aaron," said Evan. "I bet he doesn't have anything to pay a fine with. Look at this junk. Muggle boy doesn't have anything anyone would want anyway. Let's go to lunch."

"Sure," said Aaron, letting the chest lid fall with a bang. "I'm hungry. And don't you get any ideas about looking at my things or I'll wipe the floor with that big muggle nose of yours."

Russ waited until they were gone, then opened the chest and checked his things. Everything was there, though it had been tossed about untidily. He found his wand and began to murmur a guarding spell. The cousins would have a much harder time opening that chest in the future.

Having done that, Russ sat on his bed eating his sandwich and studying for his first class that afternoon, Herbology, which was followed by History of Magic. Well before one o'clock, when the Herbology class started, Russ put an additional locking charm on the chest and left the dormitory to try to find the Herbology lecture room.

The Herbology lecture classroom was on the second floor, where its windows had a view of the greenhouse complex. Russ was the first Slytherin student into the room, though there were already several Ravenclaw students ahead of him. He took a seat at a desk towards the back.

By one o'clock, all the students were there and the Herbology professor came in. The other Slytherin students had said nothing to Russ, though Mitchell had nodded.

"Well, well," he said. "Fresh new faces. I am Professor Mullein. First, I have to call your names from the register, and then we can get started." Which he proceeded to do without commentary, to Russ's great relief.

"Good. Administrative business over. Now, let's see what you already know. Who can tell me three important things that all plants need?" No one raised their hand. Mullein prompted them gently, "Now think, what do you have to give to plants?"

Russ was trying to obey his mother's instructions, but it was hard. \emph{I know I'm suppose to let them think I have no experience, but Mum was really only worried about magic. This isn't magic, it's gardening. Timidly he raised his hand.}

"Yes, you young man in the back. Remind me of your name, please."

"Severus Snape, sir."

"And what three things would you guess, Master Snape?"

"Soil, water, and sunlight."

"Excellent! Thank you. And a point to Slytherin for your answer." Mullein paused. "Your face is familiar. Are you by chance Eileen Prince's son?"

"Yes, sir."

"A good Herbology student, too, your mother. That would make you Constantina Prince's grandson. A classic witch of the old tradition. Does wonders with herbs and potions. Now, as Master Snape has told us, plants need soil, water, and sunshine. Why is that? Because unlike us poor humans or members of the animal world, plants can make their own food. And they do it with air, water, and sunshine."

The first class was basically a lesson, minus chemical equations, on what muggles would call photosynthesis. It was meant to impress on the young, as yet unschooled minds, the importance of learning exactly how much water and sunlight, and what kind of soil, each plant needed. Russ already knew that each plant had its own requirements, but he'd never learned the technical reasons why before. He enjoyed the lesson thoroughly and jotted notes in his Herbology textbook.

It turned out that most of their lessons were with the Ravenclaw students. Their other class Thursday afternoons was History of Magic, and all twenty students walked together from the second to the first floor where Professor Binns's class was.

Professor Binns was a ghost. Like Professor Mullein, he had a register of the students in the class and read it out to responses of `Here, sir' from all, but that would be the last time that year that he got their names right. This was apparently because he'd not been able to learn any new information since the day he died. He continued forward, perennially locked in 1922.

Binns started right away with lectures - it was the only teaching style he knew. And he started from the beginning with 30,000 year old Cro Magnon amulets and grave goods. Russ was glad then that he'd spent so much time reading the text in August.

Here again, Russ's quill was busy scratching small cramped notes in the margins of his books and on scraps of parchment that he tucked between the pages. Professor Binns supplemented the book with lots of tidbits of history and sociology that the book didn't contain, but Russ only knew that because he'd read ahead. He didn't notice that the other boys kept glancing at him as if a diligent student was outside their frame of reference.

Mitchell walked beside Russ as the Slytherin students returned to their house to rest before dinner. "He knows your grandmother," he said after several minutes. "Mullein, I mean."

"He seems to... know of her. I never heard... her mention him."

"Didn't she go to school here?"

"My mother was... the first Hogwarts student in... the family."

"Oh. You took a lot of notes that last class."

"He said things I... wanted to remember."

"Yeah."

They entered the dormitory together. Aaron was standing by Russ's bed trying to open the chest. Every time he yanked on the lid, the chest jumped forward and tried to crush his toes. So far Aaron had escaped, but he was so determined to force the chest that crushed toes seemed inevitable. "What did you do to this thing?" he yelled at Russ as soon as he noticed Russ's presence.

Russ thought of his mother and her warnings about not making enemies, but that was something that had started when Nana had shown her the astrology charts. There were older lessons, and some enemies come ready-made. \emph{Never let them see you're afraid. It's like blood to wolves.} His wand, kept in a special loop up the right sleeve of his robe, was ready if he needed it. The few open places in his brain were shutting down.

"I locked it," Russ replied to Aaron's question.

"You're going to open it." Aaron advanced on Russ, his hands balled into fists.

Mitchell stepped to one side, as if hoping the fight would be interesting.

"It's more fun watching you try," said Russ quietly.

Aaron paused, his eyes narrowing in reassessment, then he reached into the pocket of his robe. Russ didn't move a muscle, but his right hand now also held a wand, concealed by the loose folds of his own robe.

Turning slowly, Aaron pointed his wand at the chest and said, \emph{"Alohomora!"} Replacing the wand, he grinned at Russ. "Now we'll see," he said.

He went back to the chest and pulled at the lid. It wouldn't open, but the chest attacked him again.

"If I'd known you were still just on \emph{Standard Book of Spells, Grade One}," said Russ, "I wouldn't have wasted the effort."

Aaron pulled out his wand again, but it was clear he didn't know any other opening spells. He faced Russ, angry and frustrated, only to find that Russ's wand was pointing at him. He glared at both Russ and Mitchell, then stomped past them out of the room muttering, "Stupid half-breed," as he passed.

"That was pretty cool," Mitchell said. He looked down at Russ's right hand, but the wand had disappeared. "How'd you do that?"

Russ looked Mitchell in the eyes, his own as black as jet, impenetrable. "Do what?" he said, and went over to his bed where he sat facing the wall, trying to wind down and reopen some of the doors in his mind, a much more difficult task than closing them.

Mitchell shrugged and threw himself on his bed. "If I fall asleep, wake me for dinner," he said.

"Sure," Russ answered.

Dinner was more formal than breakfast and lunch, the whole school assembling in the Great Hall and filling the tables. Mitchell, who seemed to be perpetually hungry, left the dormitory before Russ. None of the others had come in, and Russ assumed that Aaron and Evan were together, probably with Aloysius.

Walking into the Great Hall at exactly dinner time, Russ noted that Aaron was next to Evan, but that Mitchell and Aloysius were together at a different part of the table. There was no room at the end of the table near the door, but there were several spaces along the sides. Russ walked to a section where there was an empty bench, ready to move if someone said it was taken. No one said anything, and he relaxed and looked at the food.

Over at the Gryffindor table, Lily smiled at him. She looked tired, and he reasoned that she, too, had had a busy day. Neither made any attempt to communicate. It was as if their friendship was as much a secret here as it had been in Lancashire.

That evening, back in the dormitory, Russ sat in bed and studied. He felt like he needed to find another place for that, but there were just too many new things to get used to. At home there were just him and his parents, and Lily on the odd Saturdays when she could get away. Russ was used to wide, empty, rolling moors, and the quiet back streets of a small town in a mine and mill district. And to hours and hours of being alone.

Now he was almost never alone. The school was all heavy stone pressing around him and a maze of corridors where you couldn't see the sky to get your bearings. Slytherin house didn't even have windows. The common room was crowded and noisy. The classrooms were regimented rows of desks. Russ began to doze.

Suddenly, the other boys were racing into the dormitory room, opening chests and pulling out books. Russ was wide awake immediately. He'd forgotten it was Thursday night and they had Astronomy. Together the five boys and five girls raced up out of the dungeons, running into ten Hufflepuff students on the main staircase who were going in the same direction. At least with the whole group of them together, it would be hard to get lost.

The Astronomy lecture room was on the seventh floor, and the children were all out of breath by the time they got there. Professor Sinistra, a rather calm lady with gray hair, was already waiting. "Good," she said, "you didn't forget. They sometimes do for the first lesson." She called the names on the register, then told them that this first class would be short since they'd had no preparatory lectures on what they were supposed to be looking at. This evening, they would just familiarize themselves with the location of the tower and the compass points.

Russ followed the rest up the long spiral stair of the Astronomy Tower and onto its broad, flat roof. The air was cool and clean, and it was dark enough, for though the moon was nearing full, it took a couple of hours to rise above the surrounding mountains. Looking up, Russ drew in a deep, satisfied breath, for arched above him from horizon to horizon was the vast canopy of the night sky, glittering with millions of stars.

The next morning, Friday, Russ had Defense against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration with Ravenclaw. Dark Arts was the only class where the Slytherin students didn't share the classroom with another house. Professor Wildacre was new and just getting used to the curriculum, so after calling the names on the register she set the students to memorizing the definition of Dark Arts and the five classes of dark spells (Unforgivable Curses, Curses against the Mind, Curses against the Body, Hexes, and Jinxes). It was quite dull and pointless, especially since Russ was perfectly aware that any spell could be considered a dark one if it was used in the wrong way.

Professor McGonagall in Transfiguration was more interesting, especially since school rumor had it that she was secretly an animagus. It was fun to sit there quietly and wonder what sort of animal she might transfigure herself into, while she was demonstrating how to turn a mouse into mustache wax. \emph{I wonder what happens to your mustache after the mouse is transformed back into itself. Do you have mouse guts all over your face?} Transfiguration was the only subject that was new to Russ. His mother hadn't been good at it, and had never taught him. It was the only place so far where Russ felt like he was really learning something.

In the afternoon they had Charms with Ravenclaw and the first Astronomy lecture period. Russ's delight at finding someone else in the school as small as he was didn't last long, for Aaron and Evan started a whispered speculation as to whether there wasn't more than one part-goblin in the school. Being thought related to Professor Flitwick was definitely a minus. It was in this class that Russ really had to work hard at pretending he didn't know anything. Spells were just too easy for him.

Astronomy was like Herbology - it didn't deal with magic. Here was a place where Russ's muggle knowledge could shine. His familiarity with the Apollo program and understanding of satellites and orbits stood him in good stead. The night sky was a friend, and terms like `retrograde movement' were old, familiar vocabulary.

When Russ returned to Slytherin house after dinner in the Great Hall, there was a subtle change in its mood. People noticed him, watched him, and the feeling wasn't friendly. No one said anything, but Russ was sure Aaron had mentioned he was a half-blood. He slipped as quickly as possible through the common room and into his dormitory, not going out again until most of the rest had gone to bed, when the lavatory area was empty and he could wash and brush his teeth in peace.

The following day was Saturday. Russ got to the Great Hall early, and then dawdled over his breakfast. Lily came in fifteen minutes after he did, and though they exchanged glances, neither spoke nor even signaled each other. Russ was nervous about letting the other Slytherin students know he had a Gryffindor friend, and it appeared Lily felt the same. Lily ate quickly, then said something to the girl sitting next to her, rose, and walked out of the Great Hall. A moment later, Russ followed her.

Lily was standing next to the great oak doors leading outside. As soon as she saw Russ, she slipped out the doors. Russ crossed the entrance hall and started down the passage to Slytherin house, then seemed to change his mind, turned, and went outside, too. It was like being back in Lancashire, sneaking through the streets and around the moors so that neither his family nor hers would ever see them together.

Russ saw Lily near the cliff overlooking the lake. This was his first time outside the Castle, but it was clearly not Lily's. She led him along the cliff, down a little path opposite the stands of a stadium, and along the lake shore to the trees. There the two sat under a tree, shielded from the sight of the Castle. It was as if nothing had changed.

"Are you all right?" Lily asked, looking worried.

"Yeah, fine. Why?" It wasn't a lie. Right at that moment Russ was fine.

"Everybody in Gryffindor says that Slytherins hate muggle-borns and half-bloods. That's why I didn't try to talk to you. I didn't want to get you into trouble." She paused. "They also say the students in Slytherin are wicked and practice dark magic."

"Funny. The students in Slytherin say Gryffindors are bullies and care only about power. Anyway, they already know I'm a half-blood. Some are mean about it. I don't know about the others yet. How are your classes?"

"Pretty good. We had Astronomy last night, and I kept thinking about the moon missions. Do you know that almost none of them even know people have been to the moon? I thought that was sort of dumb. But I really liked my Charms class. The professor said I'm a natural."

Russ smiled a little. "The Herbology teacher knows about my grandmother. He called her a classic witch. I think that helped a little with some of the others in the dormitory. Like making up for being half muggle."

"Do you have any friends yet?" Lily asked.

"Sure," Russ replied. "You."

They chatted for a while, and Lily asked Russ about some of the words the ghost Professor Binns had used, then they went separately back into the Castle to study and do homework. They promised to meet every Saturday and Sunday morning after breakfast. Then on Monday, they would see each other in the one class they had together - Potions.

Potions Monday morning with Gryffindor was a joke. Russ 'd helped his Nana brew medicines from time to time since he was five, and already knew a tisane from a decoction, and how to extract an essence, but Mum said not to let them know, not to make them notice, not to be a target, so he had to pretend. Professor Slughorn wandered around the room watching the students, clearly only paying attention to his favorites. Russ was too much Nana's grandson to botch a potion, so he made it the best he could - knowing Slughorn would never see it - then, when it was perfect, added a little more crushed snake fang and a few nettles, reducing the potion's quality to mediocre. Lily noticed and made a face at him, but he ignored her.

It turned out that the two of them couldn't make contact in Potions class either, for the Slytherin students were watching him, and the Gryffindor students were watching her. Not that any Slytherins suspected the friendship. They just watched him because he was a half-blood. In Lily's case it was different. The two bullying boys from the train already knew Russ and Lily were friends. They were constantly glancing over, as if to be sure she was toeing the line.

That afternoon, after Herbology, the first year Slytherins had the rest of the day off. Russ left the Castle by himself, seeking a place to be alone. He found it at the bottom of the cliff, out of sight of any window, and reachable by a narrow path. There he sat with his schoolbooks to study. Weekday afternoons were not a time to be with Lily. That was for weekend mornings when half the school was sleeping in.

Dumbledore was meeting with the teachers at exactly the same time, getting a first impression of the newest students.

"And you, Minerva? What of your charges? How is our youngest member of the Black tribe taking his exile from Slytherin?"

"That boy is mischief personified. He'll be terrorizing the whole school before he's in third year. Do you know he's already found a way to get onto the roof of Gryffindor tower?"

"Do tell? I was hoping that would take him at least two weeks. And the thin one? Lupin?"

"Shy and withdrawn. The others have been teasing him a bit, but I think it'll calm down, so I'm not saying anything. Just keeping an eye on it. Pity that he's been sick the last few days and missed this morning's classes. It makes it just that little bit harder on him."

"I was sorry to hear that, but it was not unexpected. His health is fragile. He does need to see Madam Deering on a regular basis," Dumbledore nodded to the school nurse, "but it should not interfere seriously with his studies. Are there any other areas of concern?" McGonagall shook her head, and Dumbledore turned to Slughorn. "And what of Slytherin house, Horace? Any problems surfacing there? They are not bothering the little one, the Snape boy, are they? He is a half-blood, you know."

Slughorn shook his head. "Everything smooth in Slytherin, just as usual."

McGonagall coughed slightly. "I'd keep an eye on that one if I were you. He's a loner, not shy but withdrawn. I got the feeling he was assessing everyone as a potential opponent."

Dumbledore pondered this for a long time after the others left. It was not the first time that a thin, dark-haired, pale-faced half-blood had been sorted into Slytherin house. That other one had been cold, withdrawn, and calculating, too. It bore watching. It definitely bore watching. It was fortunate that the other Slytherin boys were not teasing the child. Ostracism could be devastating to a young psyche. Dumbledore made a mental note to check frequently with Slughorn about it.

Russ returned to Slytherin house just before dinner, planning to leave his books in the dormitory. Just as he reached the door to his room, he heard a bit of conversation - Aloysius's voice.

"...just that Dad told me to get to know you because he and your dad... Well, you know... It'd be a good thing if students like us..."

Russ opened the door then, not trying to conceal his presence. He didn't want to be accused of listening at doors. Aloysius stopped talking immediately, and Evan, for that was the one he was talking to, got up from Aloysius's bed where he'd been sitting and moved across the room to his own.

Paying absolutely no attention to either one, Russ traversed the room to his corner, deposited his books, straightened his robes and his biretta, and walked out again, not having said a word to either boy. As he closed the door behind him, the conversation was renewed.

"Do you think he heard us?" Evan asked nervously.

"Nah." Aloysius's voice was scornful. "Don't worry about it. A little half-muggle like that doesn't have a clue what's going on in the real world."

\emph{It depends}, Russ thought, \emph{what you consider the real world to be}... but he made a note to talk to Lily about it on the weekend.

\emph{Friday, September 10, 1971 (the day before the last quarter moon)}

The rest of the week passed without much change. Each class was three times a week except Defense against the Dark Arts (twice) and Potions (once). The schedule was complex, but first years had only two hours in the morning daily and two in the afternoon Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday evening was the Astronomy practical session, and it appeared Friday's second afternoon hour would be for Flying Lessons. Monday after Herbology, the rest of the afternoon was free.

Russ was now spending a large part of his free time studying by the lake. He even took his lunch down there to be alone. It wasn't too bad. He was used to being either around adults or alone, and he didn't suffer much from it. It was a more pleasant place than home because here no one hit him. On the weekends he could be with Lily. The rest was minor.

Until the second Friday evening, that is. Russ went straight to dinner where he sat and ate alone as was his wont, trying not to watch Lily chatting with the other girls in her dormitory. Then he went back to his dormitory and to the lavatory to wash his hands and brush his teeth.

Aaron and Evan were there, as were a couple of third years. "Do you smell something?" one of them said.

"Smells like a mongrel to me. Muggles always smell."

Russ turned to leave the lavatory, but the third year blocked his way. "We've never seen you take a bath, half-breed, and we think you smell."

There was no point in explaining that he washed every morning before they were awake, since that wasn't what this was about. "I'll try to do better," Russ said, wishing he could see where the boys behind him were standing.

"Not good enough. I have a better idea. Why don't we give you a bath right now? We've got hot water. We've got soap. We've got the scrub brushes. Wash that muggle smell right off you, so your dorm mates can sleep tonight."

The panicky realization of what they intended was shutting Russ down completely. He stepped to one side and let his wand slide into his hand, but Aaron was ready for this. From behind, he forced Russ's wand hand down, and slipped his other arm around Russ's neck. Evan was running hot water into one of the tubs. The second third year produced soap and brushes while the one who'd blocked his way starting unbuttoning Russ's collar.

"A nice bath," he said. "To get rid of the mongrel smell."

Russ kicked out and connected with a shin, then began to struggle fiercely. His tormentor swore, seizing the smaller boy by the hair and twisting a hand in the collar. "You little mudblood spawn! I'm going to enjoy this." With Aaron's help, he dragged the kicking Russ over to the steaming tub.

Danger had by now focused everything into sharp clarity, and Russ began to broadcast silent commands, spells inspired over the last two years by words from his great-grandfather Wenny's Greek dictionary - \emph{Phouskala! Spuraki! AimaterÃ© mutÃ©!}

With cries of alarm, both Aaron and the third year released him as blisters, boils, and pustules erupted on their skins. Evan grabbed a towel and clamped it to his face to stem the sudden stream of blood from his nose. Russ, free of their grasp, lunged for the door, pausing there to issue a wordless \emph{Accio!} to his wand, which sprang into his hand. Without a backward glance, he raced for the dormitory room where he would have a wall at his back and the more neutral witness of Mitchell in case he was pursued.

He was not pursued. About five minutes later, another third year stuck his head in the door. "They'll leave you alone if you reverse the spells," he said quickly and nervously, then left.

Mitchell, who'd been watching ever since Russ came bolting into the room, asked, "What spells?" but a look at Russ's jet black eyes told him the question was futile.

After a moment, Russ released a deep breath and, wand still in hand, walked out of the dormitory to the common room and from there to the lavatory. Those students still in the common room watched him warily. At the lavatory door, Russ paused.

"I don't want you to touch me," he said.

"We won't," the third year replied. "Just undo the spell." His nose was dripping blood, and his face and hands were pocked with eruptions.

Russ pointed his wand and thought \emph{Therapeia!} four times. He didn't really need the wand at these close quarters, but it would look better to the others. Then he returned to the dormitory to calm himself and reopen doors.

Nobody bothered him for the rest of the evening. Nobody even spoke to him. Before retiring for the night, Russ walked slowly around his bed, silently casting guard spells. Though it was best to be cautious, he wasn't really worried because he didn't think they'd have the nerve to attack him. They'd gotten a taste of what he could do.

More important, they hadn't seen the scars on his back.

The next morning, Russ went straight to the Great Hall, picked up some food and made something resembling a sandwich, and went straight out to the lake and the trees past the Quidditch stadium. Lily arrived half an hour later.

"How was your week?" was her first question.

"Fine. How was yours?"

"It was great. I'm learning so much, and the other girls in the dorm are really nice. Morwen's helping me with Herbology, and I'm helping her with Astronomy. Mary has this funny tortoiseshell cat named Spooks, and Calpurnia knows all kinds of jokes. Are you having fun with your dorm mates?"

"Yeah, except they all like Quidditch, and I don't know much about it. And Aaron and Evan are cousins, and Aloysius's dad's in business with Evan's dad, so they already know each other. It's harder when they're already a group and you're the only new one. Besides, you know... me. I never had a lot of... friends anyway."

Lily looked at Russ shrewdly. "You're stammering," she said. "Are you sure everything's all right?"

"Yeah." Russ didn't want to upset Lily with his problems. He'd already realized that it was a good thing she hadn't been sorted into Slytherin. It would have been much worse for her than for him. Now he just wanted their time together to be pleasant so that she'd enjoy talking with him. Otherwise she might prefer the company of the cat, or the girl who told jokes. "What did you think of the Potions class?"

"I wanted to ask you about that! What did you do to your potion? It looked great, then all of a sudden it got cloudy."

"I told you. Mum doesn't want anyone to know they've already taught me stuff. I'm supposed to lie low for the first year or so, so we don't get in trouble with the Ministry."

"I forgot about that. Do you understand the Potions homework?"

"Sure." They spent the next hour talking about the different ways of extracting oils and essences from plants. Then they split up, Lily going to the library, and Russ staying by the lake near the boat grotto, right at the foot of the cliff.

That evening after dinner, as Russ crossed the common room to the corridor leading to the dormitories, he heard his name.

"Snape? Could I have a word with you?" It was the fifth year prefect named Rabastan.

Russ walked over to him and sat in the chair the older boy indicated. He didn't say anything.

"I hear there was a little trouble last night. Students aren't supposed to be fighting or hexing each other, you know," Rabastan said.

This was a different kind of fight. Russ shut his doors and looked Rabastan in the eyes, closed down and innocent. "They wanted to fool around. I didn't want to play. They had trouble understanding that, so I had to make it clear."

Rabastan's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "So I heard. Really clear. Where'd you learn to do that?"

"Do what?"

"Make things clear."

"No place. Some things just happen."

Now Rabastan was trying to control a frown. "Just make sure it doesn't `just happen' again."

"Yes, sir." Russ got up and went into the dormitory where Mitchell greeted him and the others ignored him. He performed his new ritual of guard spells, got into bed, and fell quickly asleep.

On Sunday, Russ started for the trees to meet Lily, but realized Aaron was watching him. He skirted the Castle, ducked into a cloistered courtyard, doubled back through the entrance hall, then slipped outside and down the passageway leading to the boat grotto. From there it was easy to tell if he'd gotten rid of his shadow, or if he was still being followed. No one came after him, and he continued downward and out along the lake shore, hidden from the view of the castle by the rocks of the cliff.

Lily had a bunch of jokes for him, courtesy of Calpurnia, and they spent an hour laughing at them. Then the interlude was over, and Russ went back to his now normal life of solitude and study, eager for the next weekend when he could again be with a friend.

It was the end of the week before Aaron and Evan were brave enough to try again. During that week, Russ noticed that others in Slytherin were watching him even more than before, but with a difference. Now there was a touch of wariness. Russ was content. \emph{Oderint dum metuant}. [\emph{Let them hate, so long as they fear.}]

Russ was consciously building a wall around himself. At every meal he took some food and went elsewhere. In every class he buried his nose in his books, refusing even to notice the names of his classmates. During free time he went to the lake or hunted for corners of the Castle where no one else went. His initial timidity at Hogwarts' great size was diminishing, and he even began exploring the dungeons. He only returned to Slytherin house for curfew and to sleep.

Classes were hard, for he still tried to obey his mother's instructions about staying unnoticed. Flitwick, McGonagall, and Wildacre, he knew, saw him in the ranks of the mediocre. Binns and Slughorn didn't see him at all. Only Mullein and Sinistra seemed to realize that he was better than he allowed others to see, though both respected his clear desire for privacy.

On the third Friday, the seventeenth, Flying Lessons started with Mr. Overhill. It was not something that Russ was looking forward to. The students lined up with their brooms, simple school brooms, to their right side, hand outstretched, and called "Up!" A few of the brooms responded. Others quivered or jerked. Russ's broom didn't move. "Up!" he repeated. "Up!" Aaron and Evan were snickering. None of the others, including the Ravenclaws with whom they were taking the lessons, seemed to notice since they were having troubles of their own.

Two Ravenclaw boys got their brooms up into their hands at the first try, as did both Aaron and Evan. No one else did as well, though others were slowly getting the idea. Russ's broom remained adamantly on the ground. Since Overhill was not about to delay the lesson for a few students, he sent those who were having no success to one side to try to get control of their brooms. The three were Russ, the Slytherin girl named Maladicta Trimble, and a Ravenclaw girl. None of them could get their brooms to move. They didn't talk to each other.

The fiasco with the broom seemed to embolden Aaron, who took it as evidence that Russ was not as powerful as previously thought. He laughed about the episode as they went in to dinner. "I swear, I was beginning to think it was the janitor's broom, that's how quiet it was, but when I tried it, it came right to hand. Guess some people aren't cut out to ride brooms. Something to do with blood."

Russ took some bread and an apple and went out into the early evening to watch the sun go down and try to forget his failure.

The other first years were in the common room when Russ reached Slytherin house just before curfew. Aaron and Evan followed him into the dormitory, Aloysius and Mitchell not far behind. Evan was doing a crude imitation of the way Russ edged sideways along the common room wall so that he had the wall to his back and was facing the others.

"You walk like a spider!" Evan sneered.

"Don't you... like spiders?" Russ asked innocently.

"Disgusting things," said Evan. "Almost as bad as muggles."

Russ didn't answer. Instead he went over to his bed and sat down. There was something different about the night stand. The drawer had been opened and not completely shut again. Russ reached over and opened the drawer. The Hufflepuff badge was gone. When he turned around, Aaron was holding it.

"That belongs... to me," Russ said coldly. "Give... it back."

"We don't want lousy Hufflepuff garbage in Slytherin any more than we want lousy half-bloods." Aaron took out his wand and pointed it at the badge.

"It's mine." Russ repeated. "Give it to me."

With a few waves of his wand, Aaron cut the badge to shreds and set it on fire. Russ said nothing, but returned to his bed. There he changed into his night clothes, then looked over to the laughing Aaron and Evan. \emph{Folia arachnon!} he thought in Evan's direction, and towards Aaron \emph{Pseires!} The lights had barely gone out when Aaron began to shriek.

The prefects got Slughorn, who got Professor Dumbledore and Madam Deering. "I have to get him upstairs," Deering said. "We need to check the whole dormitory and disinfest the bed. His head will take more than a few minutes, though. How he could have such a bad case of lice and not realize it before is beyond me." Beside her Aaron kept running his hands through his hair and blubbering.

Dumbledore looked around. Amidst the turmoil, Eileen Prince's son sat quietly on his bed looking shyly at the floor. Calm, innocent, well-behaved. "Is there anything you wish to tell me about this?" Dumbledore asked gently.

The boy shook his head, not looking up. Just so another shy exterior had masked a wizard of formidable power. Just so another half-blood boy had denied knowledge of incidents that had gradually grown to terrify his house mates.

Dumbledore helped escort the Wilkes boy up to the hospital wing. He did not wish to leap to unfair or unjustified conclusions, but he was deeply disturbed.

From the moment Aaron returned from the hospital wing, his head lice now gone, Russ's house mates in Slytherin ceased to tease him. Instead they ignored him altogether. If this was meant to be some sort of punishment for being both a half-blood and a student who could conjure a headful of lice, it didn't work. Russ didn't feel punished. He preferred to be left alone.

The only one still suffering was Evan. Starting the night of the lice, Evan discovered that he'd acquired a nest of spiders over his bed, and occasionally one would drop onto his face or into his mouth while he was sleeping, or even weave cobwebs attached to his ears or nose. His efforts to get rid of the nest weren't successful, but it seemed silly to complain to Slughorn about an occasional spider. He didn't talk to Russ about it, as that might seem like surrender.

Mitchell acted as if he might like to talk to Russ, but the other students made it clear that if he did, he would be ostracized, too. In any case, Russ never acted as if he wanted anyone to talk to him, and so it was easy to let him be by himself, and to give him a wide berth in the common room when he passed through, just to avoid unpleasantness.

Russ made it easier on the others by staying out of Slytherin house as much as possible. When he could, he used the regular lavatories on the different floors, and he found other sources of clean water in the springs that bubbled up here and there in the cliffs around the lake. He spent his spare time in the library or at the lakeside, and wrote lengthy and meticulous assignments for his different classes. Weekend mornings of course, were different.

The one failure was Flying. Russ could not control a broom. The single time he managed to mount one, it bucked and threw him off while the others laughed. It wasn't really important. There wasn't an OWL in broomsticks.

It was in Potions that Russ scared the other students. He worked alone, and by this time it wasn't just Lily who noticed him, it was all the Slytherin students as well, for Russ would make a perfect potion in record time then, while they all watched, would do something to lower its quality. When he caught another Slytherin student watching, Russ would just smile.

"Why did you do that?" Mitchell whispered to Russ after watching him intentionally get a lower grade on a potion to reduce hives. During Potions class was almost the only time they talked now. The others were usually struggling with their own potions and paid no attention.

"I don't... like Slughorn," Russ replied.

"But you get poor marks in Potions."

"Who cares? I know I can... do it. No one... else needs to know."

"But you need good marks to get a good job."

"Not from him. I checked. He doesn't... give the OWL or the NEWT, and only the... OWL and the NEWT matter."

"So what he teaches you is..."

"Baby stuff. I could pass either... test right now."

"Wicked."

Russ heard a sound and turned to find Evan watching him. Evan immediately turned away, but Russ remarked, ostensibly to Mitchell, "There are other... potions, too. Ones that can turn your... brains to jelly so they run... out your ears..." Evan moved to a table farther off.

"Where do you go during dinner?"

Russ stared at Mitchell calmly, as if he were a laboratory specimen. "My... business," he said. "Not yours."

"All right. Have it your own way."

What Professor Slughorn didn't notice, Professor Flitwick did. The talents of a student with no background in spell casting, and the talents of a student concealing a background in spell casting are quite different.

"He isn't failing at his first attempts because he can't do it," Flitwick told Dumbledore. "He's doing a different spell technique that doesn't match the spell he's supposed to do. Then, after several `unsuccessful' attempts, he switches techniques and does the spell perfectly. The other students think he's struggling to learn the material, but he's really just playing a game. The Slytherin boys seem to understand that now because they don't tease him about it anymore. They stay clear of him."

"Have you seen any evidence of his performing unusual spells, things you never saw before?"

"Would causing another student's levitation feather to tear to pieces count? I couldn't figure out how it happened, but if he did it, it was nonverbal and without direct wand action."

"Whose feather was mutilated?"

"A Slytherin boy. Aaron Wilkes."

"Did Master Wilkes think that Master Snape had done it?"

"Oh, no. He just thought he'd done the spell wrong. I didn't tell him it wasn't possible in that situation. I was trying to work out how it could have happened."

Dumbledore drummed his fingers thoughtfully on his desk after Flitwick left. \emph{Hexes, advanced spells - it makes one wonder if perhaps certain things are escaping Professor Slughorn's attention in Potions. But how to verify it?}

Until well into the small hours, Dumbledore paced his office, puzzling over patterns and coincidences and the peculiar workings of fate. Two boys, so similar - and he did not wish the second to go the way of the first.

Both were from old wizard families that were nonetheless outside the mainstream of wizard life. Dumbledore was just beginning to research the background of his former student, Tom Riddle, and the picture of an ancient and traditional, but provincial and poverty-stricken family was one part of the pattern. True that the Snape boy did not appear to be related to any of the founders, but the witches of the Pendle region had their own traditions.

Then both had the air of changeling children. Riddle, of course, had been abandoned and orphaned, left to be raised unaware of the fact that he was a wizard. Dumbledore knew of no similar problem in young Snape's family, and yet there was that strong sense that there was something other about him that Dumbledore could not quite place.

And why would the Sorting Hat place the child of a Hufflepuff girl into Slytherin house? And a half-blood to boot? It was another disturbing part to the pattern.

Dumbledore had also to add recent events. There had been no head lice when Wilkes entered Hogwarts three weeks earlier, of that Dumbledore was certain. And yet the lice had appeared without wand or warning, suddenly there. Something was happening in the first year dormitory of Slytherin house that Slughorn was blithely unaware of. Was Wilkes the offender, and Snape retaliating? Or was Snape the manipulator as Riddle had been, already gathering followers and intimidating those who would not follow? Neither boy had accused the other of anything - itself a bit of a mystery - and yet Dumbledore knew it was between the two of them.

Now Flitwick revealed that the Snape boy was deliberately concealing a talent for spells - for curses, hexes, and jinxes, no doubt - of an astounding magnitude in one so young and so outside the normal wizard milieu. Patterns were forming into dark, frightening shapes.

The Headmaster got little rest that night, for the problem was potentially a great one. They had not watched over Tom Riddle enough from the beginning, and the wizarding world was beginning to reap the consequences. It could not afford a second Lord Voldemort.

"The Snape boy? Little Severus? Why he's a darling child! I wish all my students were like him." Professor Sinistra adjusted the cap over the end of a telescope, checking for cracks and loose fitting. "He wants to come up to the tower and observe the twilight sky, particularly as the moon wanes to new and waxes again. He says it has something to do with Saturn and Apollo and America, which I don't completely understand, but I'm not about to stand in the way of such enthusiasm. And he really is looking at the sky, mind you. I've peeked up here to check."

"So he already knows a lot of astronomy?" It was something Dumbledore had not expected.

"Sir, that child knows a thing or two that I don't. He's that good. He has a few strange ideas - he thinks we should know what the other side of the moon looks like - but anything that gets a boy to want to look through a telescope is a good thing in my opinion."

"Snape? About the same as any other student. Not at ease with Transfiguration. I don't think he's ever done it before. He does have skill with a wand. I'd expect him to shine more at Charms. It's the metamorphosis he has trouble with, as if he wants things to be..."

"Yes?" Dumbledore prompted as McGonagall hesitated.

"Well, Albus, predictable. Dependable. He has that attitude, you know the one. He wants to know where he stands, and feels uncomfortable when things around him keep shifting. I don't have to tell you what a common problem that is in Transfiguration."

Wildacre thought deeply about the question. "If I were to go by his daily performance in class, I'd say mediocre. He won't answer questions, he doesn't grasp the material, he's abnormally shy... no, shy isn't the word. Reticent."

Dumbledore waited an moment, then spoke. "That is his performance in class. What else is there?"

"His written assignments. Well considered, well researched. If I didn't know he was a first year, I'd think he was preparing for OWLs. I'm not complaining, but the written performance and the spoken performance don't match."

"He's his grandmother's grandson." Mullein seemed to think no other evaluation was needed.

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "I do not know that I have ever heard of his grandmother."

"She's a local potions brewer in eastern Lancashire. I travel a lot in the summer, looking for new potions or different recipes for old ones. Mrs. Prince is a witch and healer of the classic tradition. Those in the trade know her. Severus takes after his grandmother."

"I wouldn'ta thought ya'd be so worried about one little boy," said Hagrid as he fixed Dumbledore a cup of tea.

"It is not the boy himself that I am worried about, at least not on a cosmic level. It is his potential that concerns me. There is circumstantial evidence to indicate that he knows more about certain aspects of magic than our seventh years."

"Why would ya think that was bad? Sounds good t' me." Hagrid set the cup and saucer down and watched while Dumbledore added sugar. "A boy ought t' live up t' his potential."

"Oh, Hagrid. You know what trouble a boy with too much potential can cause. You have had first hand experience. And now the wizarding world is having too much..."

Hagrid began fizzing in laughter, which caused Dumbledore to stop stirring his tea and look up in irritation. "I was not aware that I had said anything funny," he said grumpily.

The last laugh was more of a bark. "You're comparing that wee thing to We-Ain't-Supposed-t'-Say-His-Name? I weren't here yet when he was sorted into Hogwarts, but that Snape boy ain't no Tom Riddle."

"What makes you say that? You haven't seen much of him at all."

"I seen enough. Train crew says he didn't hardly try t' find a seat - just plunked hisself at the back of the train in a corridor the whole trip, with a muggle-born girl. He weren't about t' climb into a boat with the others - I had t' put him in one. He don't take meals in the Hall, an' he spends time by hisself at the lake - I seen him there. Now Tom, he'd be out there making contacts an' building power - what d' ya call it - influence. That Snape boy - he don't know nothing about building power. He just wants t' be left alone."

It was reassuring, but Dumbledore wanted more certainty. "He has used some rather strong spells against his dormitory mates."

"An' who told ya that? An' did they say why? No offense t' Professor Slughorn, mind you, but what goes on in Slytherin house can be mighty unpleasant."

"How would you know that?"

"I got ears. I got eyes. I know when a boy's being bullied. Ya don't want t' step in right off, 'cause most of the time the boys fix it themselves, but ya can see if it's there. That boy were being bullied, and then it stopped. But he's spending more time from Slytherin than before. That tells me he took care of hisself, but he ain't trying t' build anything on it. You catch my meaning?"

Dumbledore relaxed somewhat, for what Hagrid observed on a gut emotional level was usually the truth, the gut emotional level being where most young people lived. "You have been watching him, then?"

"I got me a personal interest, being the biggest one at Hogwarts, in watching out f'r the littlest. Mind, if he grows, or if someone littler shows up... Ya ever ask why he got put in Slytherin?"

"The Hat will not say, except that it has something to do with guarding secrets. That did not make me feel more comfortable about the situation."

"What secrets would a boy like that have t' hide?"

"Exactly. I do not know."

And then there was Horace Slughorn.

"Well, Albus, let me see... I don't really have a firm grasp of his character yet. The boy isn't personable, you know. His mother? I don't think I recall his mother. Not Slytherin, of course."

"No. Hufflepuff, actually."

"There you go! I knew she wasn't Slytherin."

"Have you spoken to the boy?"

"Naturally. Start of term interview and everything. Sullen child. Kept his head down the whole time. Answered in monosyllables. I'm not surprised he's doing poorly in some of his classes. Potions work - not top quality at all. I generally get better material sorted onto Slytherin."

"I am sorry to hear that. Professors Mullein and Sinistra are impressed with him. Flitwick and Wildacre think he shows promise."

"Really?" Slughorn thought for a moment. "He does have a grasp of some, uh, techniques. And if he works hard his skills, hem, could improve. It isn't a lost cause, you know."

"Have there been any other incidents in the dormitories?"

"No, no. None at all. We run a tight ship in Slytherin. Firm hand at the helm."

"Well, I am sure you are watching out for all your students. Thank you, Horace."
