\subsection{Chapter 9: Chapter 9 â€“ Portents}

[A note to the reader: This story was not written in the order in which it is presented. The first part, \emph{In Principio}, was written last. The part starting around mid October in this next chapter and continuing onward was written first, in the fall of 2005. After \emph{Deathly Hallows} was published, a few scenes from Chapter 33 of that book were incorporated into this one, and minor alterations were made to reflect canon Severus and Lily's pre-Hogwarts friendship, but other than that, the story has remained unchanged. As a result, there may be some small continuity problems. The author apologizes for this, and hopes they do not interfere with your enjoyment of the story.]

\textbf{A Difference in the Family: Second Year - Portents}

\subsection{Friday, September 1, 1972 (the day after the last quarter)}

The first year Severus attended Hogwarts, Eileen Snape had stayed with him all morning and said goodbye just as the Hogwarts Express was about to pull out of Kings Cross station. This second year, she got him to Kings Cross early with his things, then hurried back to Euston Station to return to Colne on a morning train. Severus didn't mind. They didn't have very much to talk about, having already said everything several times. Farewells in train stations have a tendency to be awkward.

Severus wandered around the station for a while, pushing his trolley with his school books and clothes, and then around ten o'clock he quietly slipped through the barrier to Platform 9 3/4 where he found a bench about half way down the platform. There he sat watching as the platform slowly filled with people. He didn't even try to see Lily, since she wouldn't be able to come over and speak to him. He'd find her on the train.

At about a quarter to eleven, Severus got his things to the train crew, except the Gladstone bag he carried his robes in, and boarded the train at about the center, moving toward the rear as he looked for an empty compartment. Passing one where the curtains were drawn, he overheard a familiar voice.

"...doing it all wrong. Dad says He said we should take time to check before we start talking to them." It sounded like Rabastan Lestrange.

"Who's he?" The voice was Aaron's.

"You know who - Him." This was Kenneth Avery. "They think if we move before we're sure of what we've got, we'll scare them away. They say we scared lots away last year, and we're not to repeat the mistake with this year's new students."

"What about the ones from last year?" said Evan's voice.

"Go slow," said Lestrange. "Business as usual. Not too nice, and not too nasty. Just normal."

There was the sound of someone coming into the car behind him, so Severus quickly moved on, wondering about the conversation he'd just eavesdropped on. \emph{Was I one of the ones they scared away last year? I'd better be careful.}

Severus found an empty compartment almost at the end of the train where he quickly changed into robes. Just before the Express started moving, three older Hufflepuff students pushed open the door. It looked like they were going to leave again as soon as they saw what house he was in, but then seemed to decide that one small Slytherin by himself probably wasn't dangerous, and came into the compartment.

"Mind if we sit here?" one of them said. He wore a prefect's badge and looked to be sixth or seventh year.

"Suit yourself," Severus replied. After a moment he added, "My mum was in Hufflepuff."

"So how come you're in Slytherin?"

"Retrograde Mercury."

The Hufflepuff students nodded sagely. "Tough luck," another of them said.

"Thanks," Severus replied.

The first Hufflepuff held out his hand. "Macmillan," he said.

"Snape," Severus responded and shook hands. The other two introduced themselves as Roper and Hopkins.

"Don't know as I've ever seen the name Snape in the Hufflepuff archives," said Macmillan.

"Her name was Prince."

"That'd be it. Did she play Gobstones? Team captain?"

"Yeah," Severus said.

"Rotten luck about Mercury."

After that, Severus stared out at the passing scenery, not trying to join in the conversation, a move that seemed to earn him more respect. An hour later there was movement in the corridor, and then the door slid open and Lily entered. She nodded to the Hufflepuff boys and walked past them to sit opposite Severus. "How was your summer?" she asked.

"Pretty good. We went to Blackpool. Yours?"

"Southern Italy and Malta."

Next to them the three boys from Hufflepuff carefully ignored the conversation, but the sight of a Slytherin boy talking to a Gryffindor girl clearly had them silently cursing the whims of Mercury in retrograde.

Lily only stayed an hour because she was afraid the other girls would get too curious about where she was, but that hour was just like old times. Amidst talk of Capri and Pompeii, of Manchester and the Beatles, Severus and Lily also managed to decide that he would help her with her Potions work, and that they would make no effort to see each other Saturday or Sunday mornings. Instead, Severus would immediately establish his old routine of not eating supper at the Slytherin table, and from time to time Lily would join him somewhere in the castle or outside.

After Lily had gone, Severus resumed watching out the window while the Hufflepuff students alternately talked or dozed. It was actually a rather comfortable train ride.

Hogsmeade station brought something new. Everyone except the first years, it seemed, went from the station to the castle by carriage - a carriage that moved by magic, since Severus could see nothing that pulled it. This time he wasn't able to avoid his house mates, and he found himself in a carriage with Aaron, Evan, and Mitchell. They nodded in greeting, but none of them said much as the carriage took them along the darkened road, through the gates, and up the hill to the castle.

It was amusing to watch the sorting from the Slytherin table, then boring to sit there for the whole welcoming feast. Severus didn't join any of the conversation, and nobody talked to him. It didn't surprise him. Nobody 'd ever wanted to talk to him except Lily, and he'd always avoided the Great Hall at meal times and thus never gotten to know them anyway. He listened to some of the chatter, but wizards weren't any more interesting than muggles, so he thought about other things.

One of the things he thought about was how dumb wizards could be. Like pens. It hadn't taken long for Severus to become completely disenchanted with quills and bottles of ink. It gave you more to carry around, the quill needed constant sharpening, and the ink stained the most careful fingers and needed to be continually blotted. A handful of ball-point pens would be much more convenient, but it took muggle brains to come up with an idea like that. Just like it took muggle brains to come up with television and lunar excursion modules. Severus was proud that he wasn't a pureblood wizard. All his brains were on the muggle side.

Then he started thinking about the others around him and what he might do if he wanted to. Like the distracting way Doris Gamp's hair kept flopping into her eyes. Severus was sure he could come up with a hair trimming spell to cure Doris's problem. Or Aaron's irritating habit of cracking his knuckles all the time. Maybe a spell to make the knuckle bones all soft and gushy so they wouldn't make that horrible sound. Severus wondered what the Greek for knuckles was.

When the feast was over, the students went to their dormitories. Everything was as it had been at the end of the first year. Severus went straight to his bed and pulled the curtains shut. He waited for Aaron to call him `Miss Prissy,' but no one said anything about it.

Mitchell stretched and yawned. "This is going to be the best start of term ever," he commented.

"How do you figure that?" Evan asked.

"Tomorrow's Saturday. We have a whole weekend before we start classes. I'm going to sleep the whole time."

Severus hadn't thought of that. He immediately put a little awakening spell on his bed so he could get up early and into the lavatory before anyone else was awake.

Aloysius came in from the common room and dumped a handful of chocoballs on a side table. "I got extras on the train," he said. "Help yourself."

Despite the fact that they'd just finished a feast, the boys pounced hungrily on the candy. Aloysius looked over to the far side of the room where Severus was getting out his pajamas. "You too, if you want, Sev," he said, and turned to open his own footlocker.

That presented a little problem. Severus had only a second to decide what to do because if he waited too long it would look suspicious. He walked over and took one chocoball from the little pile. "Thanks," he said, and bit into it. It tasted good.

Aloysius shrugged and didn't say anything. That was fine with Severus. He liked his world predictable. Business as usual.

They were all tired, so there wasn't a lot of conversation. Severus got into his curtained bed and changed into his pajamas, then crawled under the covers. He'd already put a locking spell on his footlocker and a guard spell on the bed. It didn't pay to be careless, even if Aloysius was handing out candy. Soon all five boys were sound asleep.

The next day, Severus spent the whole time outside of Slytherin house checking out all the old places he used to go. His spot by the lake was probably the best, since it was shielded from the view of the castle by the cliff itself, and you could hear if anyone started down the steep little path. Besides, there were four ways to escape - either direction along the lake shore, up the cliff, and into the boat grotto. Nobody was ever going to trap him or Lily in a corridor again.

Severus spent Sunday in the library, and then on Monday classes started.

Severus noticed several important things that first week of classes. The first was that he was followed when he left the Great Hall, having taken some food with him for supper. He'd anticipated that from the conversation he'd overheard on the train, and he made no attempt to lose his `tail.' Instead he led the follower all over the castle, finally stopping each night in a different and remote spot where he curled up in a corner to eat his supper and study one of his textbooks. Meanwhile he knew, because it was part of their plan, that Lily was sometimes staying in the hall and sometimes slipping out, and when she slipped out it was to do as he did - find a spot to study alone. Once they had everybody believing that was all they did, they could start meeting from time to time.

The second thing was that people were being nice to him. It wasn't really a `nice' nice; it was more a `not so mean as usual.' Still, it was something. Aaron absentmindedly stood aside to let Severus pass when they almost ran into each other at the dormitory door. Aloysius asked about a point on a homework assignment. Evan told a joke and looked to see if Severus was laughing along with everyone else. Mitchell was emboldened to say things like, "Good morning," and "See you in Charms."

Bella Black seemed to have risen in the world. Even though she was a fourth year student, and Rabastan Lestrange was a sixth year prefect, Rabastan seemed to be listening to and taking orders from Bella. This was totally mystifying to Severus, especially since he had no idea what they meant when they said, `You know...' to each other, something they now did with great frequency.

On September twelfth, Severus and Lily met by the lake for the first time since the term started. The rest of the school was in the Great Hall eating supper.

"Why did you give your note to Madley?" was practically the first thing Severus said when Lily arrived. "Couldn't you have thought of something else?"

"Thurstan is nice," Lily replied primly. "At first he didn't want to pass notes to Slytherins, but I told him to talk to the fifth years - one of those boys on the train was a Hufflepuff prefect, you know - and I guess they told him you were all right. When did he give it to you?"

"In Herbology. It was kind of funny, him dropping that mandrake. And then I realized he was using it to give me something. It was a pretty good idea, I guess."

"Of course it was. I always have good ideas. How's the opening of term been for you?"

"Decent, actually. Nobody's been mean yet. I keep waiting for it to change."

"Maybe they finally figured you were a decent person."

Severus snorted in disdain. "Their idea of decent isn't the same as yours."

"Do you know about gift horses?" Lily asked. "Stop looking in their mouths."

The whole rest of September was like that. The students in Slytherin were reasonably civil to Severus, but they still occasionally spied on him. Lily met him from time to time, and was wondrously supportive in most things, but pooh-poohed his suspicions. Severus trusted nothing and no one - except Lily.

By the beginning of October, the honeymoon was over. Aaron began once again to refer to `Miss Prissy,' and even told Severus he wasn't to return to Slytherin house before supper or after supper until curfew. "We need time to air the room out," was the stated reason. Severus began spending more time in the library and in the deserted classrooms, of which, it turned out, there were many. Lily was a peripheral issue.

After the beginning of October, another phase began. Slytherin students again began actively spying. Whenever Severus cast a spell in Charms, another Slytherin was there to register how he did it. Whenever a potion was brewed, another Slytherin was there to record how it was done.

Severus was beginning to get very irritated with Slytherin house, and very protective of his relationship with Lily.

\subsection{Thursday, October 19, 1972 (3 days before the full moon)}

The Slytherin dormitories were not far from the Potions classroom. A group of Slytherins headed there to relax for a couple of hours before supper, and Severus fell in behind them as they went deeper below ground to the bare damp wall that concealed the entrance to their common room under the lake. Skirting the green-lit common room and its gathering of students, Severus slipped through an opening and down the short passage that led to his dormitory.

Two of his roommates, Wilkes and Rosier, were already there, but they stopped talking to watch Severus when he walked in. "Aren't you here a little early, Miss Prissy?" sneered Wilkes. "Thought we told you never until after supper."

Severus ignored them and crossed to his bed in the far corner. His potions book went into his footlocker, and he took out his black cloak with the Slytherin badge of a coiled serpent. He rather liked the Hogwarts robes, the straight, black, belted medieval gown with its green and silver embroidery on collar and cuffs, the black academic robe bordered in front and on its wide sleeves with the same Slytherin colors, the green and silver biretta, and the black cloak. They made him looked less scrawny.

He didn't worry about the safety of his belongings. The others had tried to rifle through them the year before, as evidenced by their raw, blistered hands, but none of them had been able to break through the curse he kept on his possessions. They'd tried to tease him more the first year, too. Then a family of spiders had taken up residence right over Rosier's bed, dropping from time to time into his mouth as he slept, while Wilkes had come down with the worst case of head lice Hogwarts had seen in thirty years. After that things were more peaceful.

Swirling the cloak around his shoulders, Severus closed the footlocker with a snap of his fingers and left the dormitory and common room, unconcerned about the others or what they were doing. Wilkes and Rosier followed his small departing figure with wary eyes, then resumed their conversation.

The first stop for Severus was down the hill, into the copse behind the North Tower. The spring of a tiny stream hid there, and he went to it from time to time to wash up. It wasn't satisfactory, but he didn't care as his own appearance was of no daily concern to him. The place he avoided above all was the boys' communal lavatory with its frightening horseplay. A few of the older boys had once tried to humiliate him by forcing him to strip there, but it's hard to focus on tormenting a smaller boy when your eyelids and lips are swelling and your nose bleeding from multiple hexes, and they desisted from their sport. All in all, he considered it a success since none of the other boys had ever glimpsed his scars. Being called `Miss Prissy' by Wilkes was insignificant by comparison.

\emph{A few years in Hogwarts will teach you to defend yourself. Never let them see you're afraid. Never let them see you're weak. Don't be fooled into fighting them on their ground. Make them fight on yours.} His mother's words. Words to live by, and he'd lived by them. \emph{Oderint dum metuant}, she'd taught him, and he found part of him enjoyed making them fear.

Once into the copse he made sure there was no one to spy on him, then slipped out of cloak and robe and loosened the cuffs and belt of the gown. A quick, modest wash was enough, and he was ready to return to the Castle. It was still an hour before supper.

October was well advanced, and the Great Hall of the Castle was resplendent with harvest decorations. Even before supper was served, the Hall was crowded with hungry students. Severus slipped over to the very end of the Slytherin table nearest the doors, hoping that no one would notice his presence. Normally he'd grab a few bites to eat and sneak outside to consume them. This time, for no particular reason he glanced over at Lily.

She was near the end of the Gryffindor table with a few friends. It was amazing how comfortable she seemed with them, talking and giggling. He watched them without watching, eyes averted and head down. Once, once only, she looked back at the Slytherin table, and for a fleeting half second their eyes met. \emph{Did she wink? Or not? Does she want to meet by the lake?} He snatched a few tidbits of food from the now groaning tables, rose and left the Hall.

"Is everything all right?"

Severus jumped at Lily's sudden appearance. She'd followed him down to the lake where the moon, three days from the full, was beginning her climb into the crisp autumn sky. "Wilkes was being mean again," he answered. For some reason he felt better out here in the cold and the dark.

Lily looked down at the scraps of meat and vegetable he'd stuck inside a small bread roll. "No wonder you're so small. You don't eat anything. I never noticed that before." She sat down on a smooth boulder and untied the ends of a large dinner napkin she carried. It fell open, full of meat, bread, and sweets. "I already finished most of my supper, but I thought we could share some dessert."

Severus settled on the grass beside her. The food was delicious, and they ate in silence, Lily nibbling slowly and pressing most of it on Severus. He hadn't realized how tasty the tarts and sweetmeats would be. He hoped too many sweets wouldn't make him sick. "How come you wanted to meet tonight?"

"I just thought you looked a little down. I was afraid they were picking on you. Why didn't you tell me at the beginning of last year that things were rough in Slytherin? I could have helped."

"I didn't want to upset you. Besides, what could you have done?"

"I don't know. Maybe let you talk about it. That helps sometimes."

"I don't want to talk about it. I want to forget it. Talking to you helps me forget."

"Okay, but when I'm upset, talking helps." Lily looked up at the moon. "This is a beautiful place to watch the sky. When did you start coming here?"

"Last year. It's hidden from the castle. That's why I chose it. It gets cold, though."

They talked for a while, and Severus felt better when they returned to the castle. He kept to the edge of the common room as he made his way to the dormitory for the night. A group of older students was talking and laughing by the fire on the other side of the room. One glanced up. It was Rabastan Lestrange.

"The place stinks of mongrel," he commented loudly. "Hey, Rosier. You ever have to fumigate your dormitory?" Rosier laughed with the others, but his laughter was strained and uncomfortable. He'd never been as free with his insults as Wilkes. Thinking of spiders, no doubt.

Severus didn't respond to the mockery, but continued calmly to the dormitory, passing Wilkes and Edison on his way to his own bed. His cloak and robe went right onto the chair next to the bed. Then he took out a plain flannel nightshirt and pulled it over his head before unfastening the belt of his gown and removing it, too. He tucked his wand into the sleeve of his nightshirt.

After checking his bed automatically for hexes, Severus climbed in and nestled in the bedclothes. His mother had given him permission to show more of what he could do, and he had to think of just the right response to Lestrange's comment. So far this year, Lestrange had paid no attention to him, so this was part of the general switch from nice to mean. \emph{There's no such thing as idle jesting. They'll be testing you, probing you for weaknesses. Never let them find one.} He smiled suddenly to himself, then rolled onto his side and went to sleep.

The next morning Severus was up and dressed first, sitting quietly on his bed reading his potions book. His very presence put a damper on the conversation of the others, and they quickly got ready for the day and hurried out of the dormitory. When Severus was sure that most of Slytherin house was awake and beginning to gather in the common room before breakfast, he stood, put his potions book into the footlocker, adjusted the wand he kept in his sleeve, donned his robe and biretta, and left the dormitory. Though he looked wrapped in his own thoughts, his black eyes were darting back and forth behind lowered eyelids, assessing the position of everyone in the room.

Just as he entered the common room, Severus glanced up. The Lestrange brothers were once again by the fireplace with Bella Black, talking and laughing loudly. He fixed his glance and the hidden wand on Rabastan's back for two seconds, then walked around the edge of the room and out the door into the main Castle. He knew that Rosier had seen him, and that Rosier's eyes followed him.

About ten minutes later, as the Slytherins were moving out toward the Great Hall, Bella Black wrinkled her nose and said, "I don't want to get too personal or anything, but someone should visit the lavatories more often."

There was a general chuckle, then the others began sniffing the air as well. "Well, it isn't me," laughed Rodolphus Lestrange, then turned to his older brother. "I do believe you're the one who needs a bath."

The others began to edge away from Rabastan, laughing. The faint but unmistakable pungent odor was now permeating the air around him. In the Great Hall, the rest of Slytherin house left a comfortable space of open air between themselves and the smell. Rabastan spent all his free time in the lavatory, scrubbing his skin, but it was three days before the aroma of wet dog was gone.

Severus didn't stay to watch Rabastan's discomfort. He never gloated over the effects of curses because the only thing that mattered was the long-term result. This one was eminently successful, for Rosier didn't tease him again for the rest of the year.

\subsection{Monday, November 20, 1972 (the full moon)}

That was the last time for nearly a month that Severus and Lily were able to meet together and talk. Things were happening in Slytherin house that Severus didn't quite understand, and he was part of it. It was as if certain people were trying to push him into losing his temper, and it extended out into the corridors and classrooms of the school. Wilkes stole his quill in History of Magic, and Severus had to use a silent Accio spell to get it back. Gamp insulted his long, lank hair, so he made her own get tangled in horrid knots when she tried to comb it. When Rodolphus Lestrange called him a skinny little runt in the middle of the common room, Rodolphus began to gain weight so that a week later he was twenty pounds heavier.

\emph{If they want to push, I can push back,} was becoming Severus's main tactic and general attitude.

He kept trying to find a way to talk to Lily. It wasn't easy since he was once again being followed. A month after their October meeting, Lily and Severus did manage to sneak off to the lake again, primarily because Severus ducked behind two of the Hufflepuff boys who'd been on the train, and they concealed him from Mulciber. This time Severus took away more food from the Hall, and together he and Lily had a very respectable feast. The moon was full, and soon Lily was skipping stones across the cold, flat surface of the water.

"How do you do that?" Severus asked. Her last stone had skipped three times before it sank to the bottom.

"Petunia's boyfriend showed me. You just hold it like this between your thumb and forefinger and throw it sidearm... Like this. Didn't your dad ever teach you to throw when you were little?" Lily regretted the words almost instantly, for Severus's suddenly embarrassed look spoke volumes about how little his dad had taught him of such things. "Do you know how to throw at all?" she finished a bit lamely.

"Oh, yeah. I can snag birds pretty good," he replied. He picked up a stone, pointed to a pine tree a short distance from the water's edge, and with a quick, overhead snap, brought one of its pinecones to the ground.

Relieved that she didn't have to teach him everything, Lily set about her instruction on the fine points of stone skipping. Severus picked it up rather quickly, and soon they were side by side, skipping stones across the lake water.

"What do you miss most?" Lily asked after a while.

She didn't have to explain. He knew what she meant. "Fish and chips on Friday nights," he said.

Lily laughed. "That's a good one. We haven't had fish and chips one night at Hogwarts. I miss - listening to the latest songs with all your friends huddled over a transistor radio, and singing along with the song."

Severus didn't respond directly to this, as Lily was his only friend, and he'd never had a transistor to listen to in any case. He thought about his next answer, though. "Bonfire night," he said. "Dad always goes out and finds some old piece of junk furniture to leave in the yard for them to pick up for the bonfire. Then when they come into the yard to get it, he goes out and yells at them for being hooligans. Then they yell back, and we follow them to the old quarry for the bonfire. We all throw things at the `Guy' and roast potatoes. It's exciting."

"Yeah," said Lily. "Bonfire night is pretty good, too. I miss the airplanes. Our new house is near Gatwick, and you can always hear the planes overhead. I like to imagine that I'm in one, flying all over the world."

"Have you ever been in an airplane?"

"Not yet, but I will."

"Me either, but I will, too."

Severus dreamed that night of airplanes flying to Timbuktu, Zanzibar and Mandalay. Thinking about it the next morning, he realized they were the most exotic names he knew. Next to his dream, Hogwarts seemed dull and pedestrian.

The following Thursday, Severus came into the dormitory just before curfew to find the other four boys kneeling in the center of the floor in a circle. Wilkes, Edison, and Mulciber seemed fascinated by something in their midst while Rosier, though interested, kept a bit of a distance.

Severus started to go around them to his bed, but at just that moment Mulciber sat back on his heels, and the two bumped into each other. "Sorry," they both said at once, and Severus continued to his bed.

"Hey, Snape," Mulciber said suddenly. "You know how to control spiders, don't you?"

Severus thought for a moment. "Some... times," he said.

"See what you can do with this one."

Severus approached cautiously and looked into the circle. There was a big, fat, black spider there that for the moment wasn't moving. Severus suspected a Petrificus spell, and guessed that this was why Rosier didn't seem quite as happy as the others. "What am I... supposed to do?" he asked.

"Anything you want. All we've been able to do is make it run around and then stop. Except I think the running around is something it's doing on its own. So that means the only thing we can make it do is stop."

"Why?" said Severus.

"Just for fun. Just to practice spells. You're not a spider lover, are you?"

"Can you... make it go... backwards?" Severus asked.

"How would you do that?" responded Wilkes.

Severus let his wand slip into his hand, concentrating enough on the spider that he didn't see the surprised look on Edison's face or the admiring one on Mulciber's. Thinking for a moment, Severus pointed the wand at the spider and said, "Libera corpus!" then "Retroverso!" The spider, which had started to scurry away upon being released, began instead to step carefully backwards.

"Good one!" crowed Wilkes. "I'll have to remember it. Wonder if it works on people."

"I don't... know," said Severus. "I never... tried it before."

Mulciber looked at Severus closely. "You did that on the first try?"

Severus shrugged. "It isn't a... hard spell. You just... say it. There are... others that are... harder."

Mulciber said nothing at first. He just contemplated the spider. "Make it do something else," he demanded after a moment.

"Like what?"

"I don't care. Anything."

Pointing the wand at the spider again, Severus opened his mouth, then changed his mind. "Don't know... anything else." The wand was back in his sleeve. He turned and walked over to his bed.

"Hey!" Wilkes shouted across the room. "You can't just walk away when..." then suddenly stopped.

Severus looked up, and for a moment it looked like Mulciber was trying to communicate something silently to Wilkes that involved glaring and shaking the head. Then Mulciber stood up. "I'm tired of playing with spiders anyway. Let's go see if anything's happening in the common room."

They all left except Edison, who climbed into his bed and opened a book for his Dark Arts class. "Do you really know more spells?" he asked after a few minutes.

"Couple," Severus replied.

"Wilkes 'd be happy if you'd teach him to use them."

"Against who?" said Severus.

"I see your point," Edison replied, and went back to studying.

On a whim, Severus walked out of the dorm and down the passageway until he got to a spot where he could see most of the common room. Mulciber and Rosier were in a corner talking to Bella Black and Rabastan Lestrange. Severus pondered this as he returned to the dorm and prepared for sleep. It was all very mysterious.

\subsection{Friday December 1, 1972 (4 days before the new moon)}

It had rained the night of November thirtieth just as the temperature fell below freezing, and Hogwarts woke to a world shimmering in ice diamonds. Everything outside was slick with glare ice, and Severus found himself forced to eat breakfast in the Great Hall. Around him groups of students were planning forays between classes to slide down the hill or go skating if the shallow areas of the lake were solid enough. Severus had not yet thought of what he would do in his enforced imprisonment, knowing only that he would stay far from Slytherin house.

Someone called, "Mail's here!" and the buzz in the room grew more excited. Owls came swooping in from all sides, dropping letters and packages into the hands of lucky recipients. Severus was not usually in the hall for mail call since he was no longer getting monthly letters, and watched with some curiosity, noting how different students reacted as they got, or did not get, their mail.

Suddenly he spied a shabby, brown owl that looked like Nelson. \emph{Not possible. She has nothing to send me.} But the owl saw him and swooped down, missing his head by inches and depositing a square blue envelope in front of his plate. Then it was gone, well aware that there would be no response.

Severus didn't want to touch the envelope. \emph{It can only be bad news.} Still, bad news had to be faced eventually, and after a minute he reached for his letter. Inside was a scrap of paper and another, smaller envelope. The scrap of paper said only, `The other one thinks you want this.' He looked at the second envelope with new interest, for it represented an unusual event. Why would his muggle grandmother ask his witch grandmother to transmit a message by owl? Carefully he opened the envelope. The only thing inside was a newspaper clipping from the \emph{Guardian}. He read it twice, tucked it into his Charms textbook, and signaled Lily.

Lily met him on the seventh floor and together they crept up the spiral staircase to the top of the Astronomy Tower, a particularly appropriate place that afternoon. They had to be careful not to slip on the ice, but as everyone else was out playing and skating, they were guaranteed not to be disturbed.

"They're going on the seventh, at five-thirty in the morning. I'll be watching."

"You won't be able to see them."

"I know that. It's just... I want to be part of it."

"Well I'm not getting up at five in the morning for this. You're watching on your own."

"But you'll watch the landing, won't you? It'll be in the evening. It'll be easy."

"I don't know..."

"You have to watch. One of them's named Ronald Evans. He could be related to you or something."

This information cast a whole new light on the matter, and she agreed to join him for the landing.

\subsection{Monday December 11, 1972 (2 days before the 1st quarter)}

Once again Lily and Severus met by the lake, but this time it was a kind of pilgrimage. Lily brought the food, and Severus brought a telescope that he'd sneaked out of the astronomy classroom. With only minor mishaps, they managed to set the telescope up on the lake shore and train it at the moon, now moving into its first quarter. There was a sense of history for, as far as they knew, this would be the last time in their lifetimes that this event would happen.

"You're sure they're not going to do this again next year."

"Certain. They're not going to spend the money. This is the last mission."

"If I find out you're wrong, I'll thump you so hard..."

Severus straightened from tightening the support screws. "And what if I'm wrong? This is still just the sixth time that anyone's walked on the moon. It's historic. You can tell your grandchildren you were watching. Just like the first time on television. And Apollo 13."

"All right. Where are we looking?"

"The east side of the \emph{Mare Serenitatis}. Here, in the upper right side. This dark patch right here." Severus lit the map with a Lumos spell, and they both studied it for a while. Then they went back to adjusting the telescope. By the time they had to return to their respective dormitories, they were both convinced that they'd seen light glinting off the lunar landing module in the Sea of Serenity.

Lily went home to Surrey for the Christmas break, but Severus stayed at Hogwarts, content to be alone for once in his dormitory. The one major disappointment of the break was that the Lestrange brothers were also staying.

\subsection{Boxing Day, Tuesday, December 26, 1972 (1 day before last quarter)}

"Hey, Half-Breed!" The voice was midway between a command and a sneer. "Turn around when you're spoken to, Mongrel."

There was no escape. Severus was on the path leading to the lake, dark trees many yards ahead of him, a dusting of white snow all around, and just out of sight of the windows of the castle. No teacher would come to his defense, and no ally would watch his back. Slowly, deliberately, he turned to face Rabastan Lestrange, with Rodolphus right behind. No one else, just the two. Severus said nothing, but his black eyes flicked from side to side, assessing the terrain. The two above him with a downhill slope at his back was not good.

"We need wood for the fire in the common room, and you're going to collect it and carry it on your back like a good little donkey, and then you're going to scrub all the floors in Slytherin house, and maybe entertain us all with a little dancing and singing. How does that sound, Half-Breed?" Rabastan stopped about twenty feet away, a malicious grin on his face. Behind him Rodolphus was chuckling.

"I don't think so," said Severus.

"I think the little second year needs a lesson in respect, don't you, Dolf? A dip in the lake, a roll in the snow. We'll leave your robes on the entrance steps and you can get dressed again there. After you bring up the wood."

Severus didn't answer. He was shutting down and closing off all the parts of his mind that might be seen during eye contact. His mother's presence was palpable. \emph{Keep your mind closed, child. Don't give them weapons to use against you. Don't watch my hand, watch my thoughts. You'll see the wand in my brain before you see it in my hand.} Poised and ready, he fingered his own wand where it lay hidden in his sleeve. Then his black eyes met Rabastan's brown ones and he saw the Petrificus spell forming behind Rabastan's eyes.

\emph{Petra!} He thought the spell rather than say it, and a rock dislodged itself from the hill behind the Lestrange brothers and slammed into the back of Rabastan's shoulder. The brothers wheeled, searching the hillside for hidden enemies. "What was that?" yelled Rodolphus.

"I have friends," Severus said quietly.

A furious Rabastan turned on him. "We'll see about that." His wand was out and he screamed, \emph{"Petrificus Totalus!"} at the same time that Rodolphus attacked with an Expelliarmus, but Severus had already cried out, \emph{"Protego!"} while his brain was sending a stream of Petra and Chioni spells.

As rocks and snowballs pelted the brothers, Severus turned and ran fifty feet to his right and a little way up the hill, still not far enough to be seen from the windows. Spinning around with another Protego already spurting from his wand, he barely managed to avoid two Pugnatio spells, but the combined impact of the double hit against his own shield knocked him down.

Severus started to scramble to his feet, saw another Petrificus coming, and dove to the left. He was truly frightened now. Rabastan was sixth year, and Rodolphus was fourth. Either one he could take alone, but the two together were stronger than he was. They could keep him here, pinned on the hillside, until his strength waned, and then he would be theirs. And the fight would have made them angrier. Fear inspired desperation, and desperation focused every ounce of his slender being into one last-ditch effort to escape. Rolling onto his back, he pointed his wand at the rocks beneath the Lestrange brothers' feet and, concentrating all his energy into the one spell, hissed "Se-e-ismo-o-os" in a long serpentine sigh.

The earth of the hillside heaved and rocked, chunks breaking off and striking at Rabastan's and Rodolphus's ankles. The brothers lost balance and fell, sliding several feet down the hill in a miniature avalanche. Like a flash, Severus was up and running for the castle. By the time the brothers were able to stand, he was over the rise of the hill and out of their range.

Rabastan laid his hand on his brother's shoulder. Far from being angry, both brothers looked immensely pleased. "Never saw that one before, and I bet no one else has either," Rabastan said calmly, "Mulciber was right. The little half-breed's a fighter. Back him into a corner and he's worth half a dozen of the others. Potions and spells... I think the Dark Lord will be very interested in him."

"I'll tell Bella she was right," said Rodolphus. "She can begin recruiting him as soon as the new term starts."

\subsection{Saturday, January 6, 1973 (2 days after the new moon)}

The Saturday after New Year's Day, everyone arrived back on the train - Edison, Mulciber, Wilkes and Rosier, Bella Black, and especially Lily. In fact, if Severus hadn't been so eager to catch a glimpse of Lily, he might have noticed the Lestrange brothers talking to Bella in the common room, and Bella alternately nodding and shaking her head.
