\subsection{Chapter 32: Chapter 32 â€“ Suspended Sentence}

\textbf{Severus Snape: The Middle Years Part II - Suspended Sentence}

\emph{Monday, August 1, 1983 (1 day before the last quarter)}

Packing his Gladstone bag to return to Hogwarts on the first of August was becoming a routine action for Professor Severus Snape. This was now the start of his third year teaching and, despite his continued feeling of being trapped in the job, he was beginning to think of it as at least 'normal.' He'd said his good-byes to Mrs. Hanson, the crowd at the pub, and the clerks at the stores he patronized so now, as he stood prepared to disapparate from the area yard behind his little house in the little town in the Pendle district of Lancashire, there was no reason to delay.

Professor Snape did not disapparate. Instead he left his Gladstone bag in the area yard and went back into his house and fixed another cup of tea.

\emph{I don't want to go to Hogwarts. I hate Hogwarts. I hate teaching. Why don't I just take off for Mallorca? Bariloche? So what if I don't know how to ski? I can learn. Or Acapulco? Ditto swimming. Anything but Hogwarts.}

In the end, it was not what he would face at Hogwarts, but what he would face if he didn't go to Hogwarts, that decided the question. Draining the last cup of tea in his own home for the next four and a half months, Professor Snape returned to the area yard and disapparated.

"Bit late, aren't you?" The familiar gruff voice spoke practically into Snape's ear.

"It's still summer," Snape replied. "We're not punching a clock yet."

"Me," said Alastor Moody, "I wouldn't want to punch a clock at the best of times. Besides injuring your hand, it's got to do damage to the clock. That could be a whole new reason for going to Azkaban, you know. Damage to ministerial timepieces."

"Did you have another reason for accosting me on a public street?"

"No." Moody grinned a rather predatory grin. "Just a vested interest in whether or not you follow your orders. I'm still waiting to welcome you to a cell in Azkaban. Even if it takes until a certain judge retires, I'll still be waiting. There's a debt yet to be paid."

And with that, Moody disapparated.

\emph{Routine}, Snape thought bitterly. \emph{It's all becoming routine. Even Moody. Maybe getting hauled into the Ministry of Magic for interrogation will become routine, too.} He thought about that on the way up the hill to the castle, and was forced to admit to himself that he hadn't been hauled into the Ministry of Magic the previous year. He'd gone there of his own volition - once to try to help Professor McGonagall, and once because he was asking the court for an injunction. Both voluntary. And the questioning at Hogwarts had not been some form of blatant harassment, but actually required by the circumstances. \emph{Maybe I won't be bothered by the Ministry this year. That would be nice.}

Another part of his routine greeted Snape in the dungeons - potions ingredients and requisition forms. The first year it had been a challenge. Now it was routine. Next year it would be boring. He thought of the classes. They wouldn't be boring, they would be infuriating. Starting the first of September, he would have three and a half months of unremitting irritation. It was too much to bear.

Locking his rooms, Snape left the dungeons and headed for Dumbledore's office.

"I want a change of job," Snape announced without preamble as soon as he was admitted.

"Good morning, Severus," said Dumbledore mildly. "I trust you had a pleasant summer break. I myself went snorkeling in the Bahamas. A most refreshing and invigorating holiday."

"I stayed home," said Snape. "It was all right. I want a change of job."

"But you are admirably qualified to teach Potions. To what other job would you bring so much knowledge and expertise?"

Snape had the answer all ready. "Defense against the Dark Arts. I've been studying it since I was four. I got Outstandings on my OWL and my NEWT, I've worked under the darkest of dark wizards of our time, and I know all about defending myself from just about anything. And not from books, either. I could teach the course blindfolded."

"That would be amusing, but I would hesitate to make it part of the job description. I do, however, get the feeling that there is some other major but unmentioned consideration. I have an inkling of what it might be, if you would be so kind as to confirm my hunch." Dumbledore peered at Snape over the top of his glasses, a twinkle in his eyes.

Snape sighed. "Dark Arts doesn't mix the houses. I'd never again have to teach Slytherin and Gryffindor together except at NEWT level. My life would be so much more pleasant."

"I see," said Dumbledore. "Have a seat, Severus. Tea perhaps?"

Snape sat in the chair in front of Dumbledore's desk and accepted a cup of tea. \emph{At least he's willing to talk about it and not just turn me down flat.}

"Now, Severus," Dumbledore said calmly. "What is your philosophy about the Dark Arts?"

"Philosophy? Why do I need a philosophy? You never asked if I had a philosophy about Potions." Snape sipped his tea, but was already not liking the turn of the conversation.

"Even you must admit that the Dark Arts are in rather a different league from Potions. In order to teach defense against them, you must teach how to recognize them. So what, in your opinion, are the Dark Arts?"

"Everything and nothing. Constantly changing, What we call Light one moment can be Dark the next and vice versa. Shifting and mutating like a kaleidoscope."

"So in other words, you would teach Defense against Everything? I can see where this could become an interesting class."

"Sir, I know that you and I disagree on this, but anything used for evil purposes, even something as seemingly innocent as a Lumos spell, becomes at that moment Dark Magic. And any normally Dark thing, used for a good purpose, becomes at that moment Light. It's a matter of recognizing the purpose rather than the thing."

"We shall postpone for the moment any discussion on your assumptions about me and focus on the practical aspects of your comments. Can you expand on your opinion? How can Dark creatures become Light?"

"One of the Darkest there is, is a Dementor. But Dementors are serving the wizarding world as guards at Azkaban. Would you accuse the Ministry of practicing the Dark Arts?"

"Point well taken. And the Unforgivable Curses? Can you envision any situation where the Killing Curse or the Cruciatus Curse might be used for good?"

"Headmaster," said Snape with a rueful half-smile, "I can envision a number of such scenarios. And I remind you that the aurors were given permission to use exactly those spells to combat the Dark Lord. Again, would you accuse the Ministry..."

"No, Severus, I would not. Certainly not under the circumstances, though I must point out that not all of the aurors took advantage of that permission. Now, why do you believe that I do not agree with you?"

Snape paused to weigh his words carefully. "Because, sir, there were students in this school who used Dark Magic on a regular, almost daily basis, and not only were they not punished for it, they were allowed to assert to the rest of the school without contradiction that they hated the Dark Arts and anyone who practiced them, despite the fact that they themselves were the worst practitioners."

"Ah, Severus," Dumbledore replied with a sigh, "we cannot censor everything a student says. More to the point, did you ever hear a teacher support that statement?"

After thinking for a moment, Snape said, "No, sir."

"And they were punished. We just did not think it necessary to inform you, a student in another house, every time James Potter and Sirius Black were placed on detention. The student who was never punished for his hexes, curses, and jinxes was you."

"Sir?"

"Were you ever placed on detention for anything you did?"

"No, sir, but..."

"Do you think we never noticed? Do you think that every time you were brought before me and insisted that you, Potter, and Black were having a perfectly amicable conversation that I believed you?"

Snape blushed at this, realized it, and cursed his own lack of emotional control. "Actually, sir, that's exactly what I believed."

"Why ever did you believe that?"

"Because you never punished me. I assumed you never punished them."

"My dear Severus. Filch has boxes and boxes of files with detailed descriptions of every detention and its reason since the school started to give detentions instead of corporal punishment. James and Sirius figure prominently, as do Aaron, Evan, and Aloysius, and to a lesser extent Remus, Peter, and several lesser lights of all the houses. Your name is not on those cards either as perpetrator or as victim."

"Why not?"

"Because you alone never initiated an exchange. You alone acted only in retaliation - in self defense as it were. And with the sole exception of a certain incident involving a werewolf, you alone never appealed to authority to get anyone else in trouble."

"I don't think it was wise to do that," Snape said quietly. "Leave me alone, I mean. I always got the feeling that I had to look out for myself because no one else would."

"And who first gave you that idea?"

"My mother, I suppose. But it was reinforced the first day at Hogwarts."

"I am intrigued. How so?"

"Day to day discipline is handled by the prefects. The prefects are supervised by the Head Boy and Head Girl. They're always Gryffindors, so Gryffindor house rules the other houses. We were warned about that on the first day by our prefects."

"I see. I must confess I had not looked at it in quite that way. There is nothing at this moment that I can do, as the new Head Boy and Girl have already been named - and yes, they are from Gryffindor house - but I shall keep it in mind for next year. Now, as for your request, there are three reasons why I cannot grant it. The first is that I need you in the Potions position. Our students' performance has improved immensely in the two years that you have been here, and I do not wish to lose that. Secondly, I have already found and hired a Dark Arts professor. Third, I do not think that I can defend to the Ministry of Magic the placing of a known (at least within the Ministry) Death Eater in the Dark Arts slot. It would raise too many fears, and quiet none."

"So the answer is no."

"That is correct, Severus. The answer is no. Did you honestly expect any other?"

"Not really, sir," said Snape. He rose and left the office, placing the cup of tea unfinished on the desk behind him.

\emph{It will never end}, he thought on his way back down the long staircases to his rooms in the dungeons. \emph{You can live out your life in harmless work, you can even try to make amends through sacrifice and service, and all they'll ever remember is the mistake you made when you were eighteen. You're supposed to be able to atone for your sins. Potter never atoned for his, but they'll forgive him anything because he died. I bet if I died for them, they still wouldn't forgive me. The world is like Slughorn. If you're rich, good-looking and pureblood, you can do anything you want...}

August slipped into comfortable routine. Snape ordered, received, and unpacked his stores. He played cribbage with Flitwick, planned a kitchen herb garden with Sprout, discussed Quidditch with Kettleburn, and sparred lightly with McGonagall. Hagrid clucked over his meals, and the new Dark Arts instructor benefited from advice that Snape would apparently never be allowed to use himself in a classroom.

On Thursday, September first, as the moon began its slide to new, the train arrived with its cargo of old-new students, and after a day and a weekend of orientation and unpacking, the school year began. Snape had almost forgotten what an incredible collection of dunderheads he was doomed to teach.

"Clockwise, Ridgebit! Clockwise! Don't pretend you've never seen the face of a clock before. Or if that's too complicated, try right, down, left, up. Ah, I see left and right are mysteries as well. Are you sure there's no troll blood in the family tree?"

"Could I trouble you, Chittock, to look at the top of the page? Do you see where it says 'Herbal Infusion?' Now I distinctly recall having seen you in this same seat last year and the year before, and I know that we covered the difference between herbs and toad bile. Kindly explain why you took it upon yourself to make the substitution."

"You dare drop that vial of Bundimun secretion on the floor, Lufkin, and you'll be cleaning it up with your tongue!"

With the first day of classes, Snape was exhausted every evening. If anyone had asked him to bet on his chances of surviving the term, much less the year, he'd have wagered every penny and knut he possessed on an early demise.

It was with the desperation of an already drowning man that Snape contemplated the evening of Thursday, the eighth of September, the day after the new moon, and Snape's first official evening off. His last class ended at four o'clock, and he determined to leave immediately. He had no desire whatsoever to spend dinner supervising students.

Dumbledore agreed without demure, so shortly after four o'clock, his rooms secured for the evening, Professor Snape walked down the hill from the castle in the full light of a September afternoon to apparate to the Leaky Cauldron. It was an eminently suitable starting point, being on Charing Cross Road and in the heart of London's theater district. He was hoping to buy books, have dinner, and take in a play or movie.

What Snape saw upon walking into a busy London street was a news vendor. What he saw in the headlines made him purchase a paper and slip at once into the Leaky Cauldron to read it over a glass of mead. He barely noticed Alastor Moody sliding into the chair opposite until Moody asked, "What are you reading that for?"

For answer, Snape showed him the front page, the article about a Korean passenger plane being shot down by Soviet military aircraft a week before.

"So?" Moody asked, clearly puzzled. "A muggle airplane goes down. It's happened before."

"Not like this," Snape answered. "The American president and the Soviet premier are rattling swords and calling each other inhuman and brutal. If this blows up - and it could, tempers are high - the wizarding world would be in just as much danger as the muggle world. We have nothing as big as they have. We're ants."

Moody stared at Snape for a moment. "You're serious," he said. "You really think this could be dangerous."

"All you need is one glitch on one tracking computer at a time like this, and the whole world goes up in smoke."*

"What's a glitch?" said Moody. "And what's a tracking computer?"

"A glitch is a mistake, an unexpected problem. A computer is a machine that muggles use to do high-speed, complex calculations. Why are you following me? Why don't you just leave me alone?"

"A missing eye gives you a long memory. Give me one good reason why I should leave you alone."

Snape looked at his hands, inspiration dawning. "Last year you helped get me off a poisoning charge because you had to testify that I hadn't gone anywhere near any poisons on my days off. Your following me kept me out of Azkaban."

Moody leaned back in his chair and roared with laughter, then lowered his voice. "So you're trying to lose your alibi! First you tell me the world's coming to an end anyway, so what's the point, and then you tell me I can get you into Azkaban faster if I stop tailing you."

"Something like that," said Snape.

Draining the glass he'd brought over with him, Moody rose and patted Snape roughly on the shoulder. "I didn't think you could do it, but you came up with a reason I can't fault. You realize this now leaves me free to concoct charges that you don't have an alibi for?"

"I'll take my chances," Snape replied calmly.

Moody left, and Snape went out into muggle London to buy a book, enjoy a meal, and watch a movie. As the weeks, and later the years went by, it was a routine that he found impossible to break. A new book, dinner, and a movie or a play, always alone, always too drained by a week of frustrating contact with a couple of hundred teenagers to want anything more than emotional isolation. On the plus side of things, he learned a lot.

Hogwarts, too, was an unchanging routine. Cribbage with Flitwick, the herb garden with Sprout, discussing muggles with Dawson and astronomy with Sinistra, conspiring with Kettleburn and exchanging barbs with McGonagall... There were times when it was immensely comforting, like having a big family, and then there were times...

"...and I was so eager to show him how much I'd learned..." Dawson was gushing after dinner in late January...

"That she took the second curve too wide, hung up her skis, fell over sideways, and slid halfway down the slope on her nose, which is why it looks that way now."

The staff room was suddenly quiet as the teachers turned to glare at Snape. "That was my story," Dawson said accusingly in the stillness. "You should have let me finish it."

"Oh, I am sorry," Snape replied, his voice dripping sarcasm. "It's just that you've told it so often I was certain you wanted us to get it by heart. I merely wished to let you know you'd succeeded."

"Severus!" McGonagall snapped, but Snape was already on his feet, his untouched glass of wine forgotten on the table beside him.

"If you'll excuse me," he said icily, "I believe it's time to go watch the spiders spin webs in the dungeons. At least down there they do it differently each time. It provides spice to life, the variety."

"You know," Dawson said, her arms folded across her chest, "if you'd stop pinching pennies and go out and do something in your life, maybe you'd be able to tell us some of your own stories instead of living vicariously off of others. If I'd locked myself in a dungeon I'd have been an octogenarian at the age of twenty-four, too."

Snape didn't reply. He turned on his heel and swept out of the staff room heading for Dumbledore's office. Behind him the others heaved a collective sigh of relief.

"He's the only one who never left the school during the whole Christmas break," Flitwick told Dawson. "I don't think he's ever been anywhere."

Up in Dumbledore's office, Snape was pacing like a caged tiger. "I want to leave. I want to get out of Britain. I want to at least try to be a normal human being, if even for once in my life!"

Dumbledore sighed. "You know that's impossible."

"Why does it have to be impossible?" Snape's voice was rising, angry, building to an explosion. "I'm supposed to stay under your authority, not chained in a kennel! Keep me under your authority - just send me somewhere!"

"The terms of your parole are rather strict. You are to remain where the Ministry of Magic has jurisdiction. You are not allowed to leave Britain. That is in addition to the requirement to be under my authority."

"For how long?"

"I beg your pardon?"

"For how long? For the rest of my life? Even after I die? Is that why Professor Binns is still here?"

"May I ask, Severus, what brought this on?"

Snape turned to stare into the fireplace. It seemed silly now that he had to put it into words. "Professor Dawson has been talking about skiing in the Alps for the past month. Do you realize how frustrating it is to have to listen to everyone talking about their holidays when you're not permitted to go on one of your own. Even you do it. Snorkeling in the Bahamas." Snape mimicked Dumbledore, not hiding the note of bitterness. "And how was your summer break, Severus? Did you enjoy comparing laundry powder prices with the ladies in the market? Such a scintillating life you lead."

Dumbledore steepled his fingers, peering over the tips. "There are places in Britain where you could go, are there not? The Lake District is beautiful any time of year."

"Where my every move would be watched by some auror or other."

"Has Alastor been following you again? He is supposed to stop that."

"Just one time. As long as I stick to my London routine, he's content to leave me alone. But if I go somewhere else, I'm pretty sure he'll check on me."

"And there is no... eh... other person in your life?"

"Right," said Snape. "Who am I supposed to be dating now, Sinistra? Or maybe I met someone at one of those fancy balls I'm always being invited to at the Ministry." He paused for a few seconds. "It isn't that I need someone, at least I don't think I do. What I need is a change. I need to go somewhere, do something, not be caged all the time. I need something besides Hogwarts."

"And I suggested the Lake District."

"Headmaster," Snape said suddenly. "What would the Ministry do if I left Britain and went to, say, Canada? Or New Zealand?"

"I should very much like to discourage you from making any such plans. You still have promises to keep, you know."

"What promises?"

"To protect a certain young gentleman as he grows and matures."

"Gentleman. I like that. So we're going to hire the half-blood working class stiff out for domestic service to nursemaid the rich pureblood's 'gentleman' son. I think I will run away to sea."

"He's Lily's son, too, Severus. Please do not forget that."

"Right. Which means he'll hate me already. Tuney will have seen to that."

"Tuney?"

"Lily's sister Petunia. 'Ew, Lily, he's that Snape boy from Spinner's End. You don't want to dirty yourself talking to trash like that...' Because I was poor, and from the wrong side of the river. She might even have become reconciled to the magic as long as it didn't include me."

Dumbledore sighed. "I had not realized there was bad blood between you and Petunia."

"Would it have made a difference?" Snape watched the flickering fire, trying to keep the images of Lily out of his head.

"No. What makes a difference is that the boy, Lily's boy, is still in danger, and you have promised to stay here, to help me, and to protect him when the time comes. I shall hold you to that promise, and I shall hold any attempt on your part to leave - be it to New Zealand or to Azkaban - as a violation of that promise."

It was Snape's turn to sigh. "It's been well over two years, sir. Why are you so sure that he's coming back?"

"There was no body," Dumbledore said quietly. "It was as if he'd vaporized. And then there is the testimony of the Lestranges. You yourself admitted to the strength of that."

"You're right. That was disturbing. But it's been more than two years and no sign of him The evidence grows stronger every week that dear Bella and company were wrong. Don't you think?"

"But then there is the matter of the curse." Before Snape could respond, Dumbledore asked, "Do you remember your Dark Arts instructor, Severus?"

Puzzled, Snape thought for a moment. "Instructor, Headmaster? There were several. A new one every year as I recall."

"Yes. The winter before you started, he came here himself and requested the Dark Arts position. I turned him down, of course. Things had not yet gotten bad, but there were enough rumors. The position has been cursed ever since. No professor stays longer than a year."

"Surely now that he's gone..." It was Snape's turn to peer at Dumbledore. "The last two years don't count," he blurted out. "Scrimgeour was only here because of him, and maybe a little because of me, and he left because the Dark Lord had been defeated. He's Ministry. He never intended to stay."

The way Dumbledore raised his eyebrows was, Snape knew, intended to be infuriating, so he plowed forward. "And Carmichael. It was temporary from the first moment. She was divorcing her husband and never meant to stay here longer than the year. And this new one. Isn't she supposed to depart next June?"

"Which means?"

"It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You only hire people for a year, and then claim the position is cursed because they only stay for a year. Excuse me. Case not yet proven."

"How often did you see him?"

"A few times," said Snape, surprised at the question.

"What did he look like?"

"Slate tiles."

"I beg your pardon?"

"I was just a potions maker, not inner echelon at all, well not 'til I got this job." Snape self-consciously rubbed his left arm. "If I got called in, I had to kneel in the chamber, and then he would enter. We didn't look at him, not unless he wanted to read us and then we only saw the eyes. They were red. No, we looked at the floor. Which was paved with slate tiles. When we witnessed punishments, he wore a mask..."

"You never saw him?"

"Well, just glimpses. He... he looked like a snake with red eyes, but that may have been a mask."

"Did you know he attended school here at Hogwarts?"

Snape stared at Dumbledore. The surprise combined with a lack of personal threat meant that for once he was, relatively speaking, open. Dumbledore turned away after a moment, as if unwilling to push his advantage. There was a pause, and then Snape said, "I can't imagine him ever being... young enough to be a student."

"Not only young enough, but exceptionally handsome. A very personable young man when he wanted to be. And yet on that winter day there was almost no trace of that handsome young man left. He had been practicing some very dark magic indeed, and it had taken its toll."

"What kind of dark magic, Headmaster?" Snape's voice dropped to a whisper.

Dumbledore shrugged. "I do not know," he said, and he was not whispering. "All I know is that it had diminished him in some way. That, an old man's hunch, and the lack of a \emph{corpus delicti} (if you will pardon the pun) are in and of themselves grounds for suspicion. When you add to that the testimony of the Lestranges, it is practically an ironclad case. Moriarty is out there somewhere, and at sometime in the future, I am certain he will come back. When he does, it is logical to assume he will still be after Lily's son. You, Severus, have promises to keep, and miles to go..."

"...before I sleep," Snape finished. "Miles to go before I sleep. Do you think that's what she meant? That I would tire, and want to stop, but that I had to keep my promises?"

"If you think she was the one speaking to you. But if not, then it was your own brain speaking to you. How much sleep will you get if even your own brain is concerned about the promises?"

There was nothing to refute the line of argument. Snape thanked Dumbledore and returned to his own rooms to ponder the nature of self-imposed obligation. He ended up deciding that he would prefer not to disappoint Lily.

And then, of course, there was Quidditch and the House Cup. From the moment he became head of Slytherin, Snape had formed an understanding with his Quidditch team. It was principally a matter of letting them do what they did best - play Quidditch. The Slytherin team opened up for Snape the mysteries of the game, which turned out to be mathematical as well as physical. It did no good, for example, to catch the Snitch early on in the last game against Hufflepuff if Gryffindor was ahead by a hundred points in cumulative scoring.

The backbone of a Quidditch team were its Keeper and Beaters. Far more than the hotshot Seeker and Chasers, they controlled the pace of the game and its strategy. They also understood more how each game fit into the seasonal pattern, and they were the ones who struggled to keep the glory-hunters, the Seekers, in line. Slytherin lost more than one game to a brain-dead Seeker who couldn't cope with the fact that catching the Snitch was not always the best thing to do.

Snape developed his best relationships with the Beaters. Steady and reliable, they always placed the welfare of the team ahead of their own. Two of Snape's favorites were the Beaters of his second and third year: Sergey Duval and Josh Van Zandt. Not children of Death Eaters, they nevertheless took it upon themselves to back Snape up in a series of small confrontations both in Hogwarts and in Hogsmeade, and were instrumental in seeing that the Death Eater children of Slytherin were protected from reprisals. They saw Slytherin as a team in much the same way they saw the Quidditch team, and did their job as Beaters in both places.

Together, in the 1983 to 1984 season, Sergey and Josh led Slytherin to its first Quidditch Cup and House Cup in decades. McGonagall was more miffed than at her loss to Hufflepuff the year before, Kettleburn was delighted, and Snape was fired with a pride of house he'd never known as a student. The sad part was that it was Sergey's last year at Hogwarts, and Josh left the year following. That year, with Josh breaking in a new Beater, Lorelei Deverill, Gryffindor came from behind to once again won both Cups.

In September 1985, Gryffindor unleashed its secret weapon on an unsuspecting Hogwarts - a short, stocky, freckled second year student with flaming red hair named Charlie Weasley. Built like a Beater, Charlie was quickly revealed as possibly the greatest natural-born Seeker Hogwarts, perhaps the world, had ever seen. Blessed with a Beater's understanding of strategy, a Keeper's appreciation for defense, and a Chaser's determination to keep fighting, Charlie also had the speed and vision of a hawk, and never once came up empty after he'd spotted and targeted a Snitch. Even at the age of twelve, it was understood that he would play for England.

Gryffindor swept all its Quidditch games that year, but it was also the year that the Slytherin Beater team of Lorelei Deverill and Sancho Folkenstone was formed. And it was Sancho, watching Slytherin beaten into the dust by the Weasley hammer, that utterly changed Slytherin's attitude toward the Cups.

"Why do we have to assume that winning the House Cup is tied to winning the Quidditch Cup?" Sancho asked in the common room, having been in a state of shock for three days after the pummeling he received at Gryffindor's hands. "We're a good house, an intelligent house, a hardworking house. We can rack up points all over the place. We don't have to depend on winning at Quidditch!"

The Slytherin juggernaut was born that day. When Pamela Pucey balked at tutoring William Higgs in Charms, Sancho yelled at her, "Don't you want to win the House Cup?" and the sentence became a rallying cry for the whole house. Slacking students were encouraged to succeed by the admonition 'Don't you want to win the House Cup?' and rule-breakers were reminded that what they did affected the welfare of everyone. Slytherin's spirit of competition was on fire. Snape didn't have to do anything but watch as the emeralds in his house's hourglass rose higher and higher.

In June 1986, Gryffindor was the proud possessor of the Quidditch Cup, but the Great Hall was decorated in green and silver for the Farewell Feast. Green and silver would be the June color of the hall for many years to come.

That was when Snape played a card that McGonagall would never forgive him for. He discovered that Charlie Weasley was interested in dragons, introduced him to Hagrid, and suggested he take Care of Magical Creatures in his third year. Charlie abandoned Quidditch for Welsh Greens and never looked back. Kettleburn was thrilled, as were Flitwick and Sprout for quite different reasons, but it was a whole year before Snape stopped watching his back when McGonagall was around.

From then on, the Quidditch Cup was up for grabs between Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. Sometimes one house won it, sometimes another. The only constant was that it never again went to Gryffindor during the eighties. Snape put it down to the fact that Gryffindor was now a prisoner of the 'Charlie Weasley complex.' Instead of relying on overall teamwork, they kept looking for that one shining star, that one miraculous player, who would single-handedly snatch victory for them. For years, they didn't find one.

The passage of time alters all things. As the innocent pastimes of Quidditch and inter-house competition gained in importance, so the memory of the bad times receded. Death Eater children graduated, the Dark Lord did not return, and by the second half of the eighties, it seemed no one remembered that Snape had ever been accused of being a Death Eater. Except for Quidditch, life had become a deadly, stultifying routine.

In August 1988, the Hogwarts staff was joined by two new teachers - Charity Burbage in Muggle Studies, and Quirinus Quirrell in Defense against the Dark Arts.
